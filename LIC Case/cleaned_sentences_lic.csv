""if the action of the state is related to contractual obligations arising out of the court

building owned by the port trust was exempted from the rent act, on A28 for

action of the port trust was arbitrary and no public interest would be served by terminating the
tenancy. in that context, this court held that even in contractual relations the court cannot ignore
that the public authority must have constitutional conscience so that any interpretation put up must
be to avoid arbitrary action, lest the authority would be permitted to flourish as imperium a imperia. whatever be the activity of the public authority, it must meet the test of article 14 and judicial

checked under article 14."
"their action must be subject to rule of law. if the governmental action

imprint of public interest element in their offers with terms and conditions mentioned in the
appropriate table inviting the public to enter into contract of life insurance. it is not a pure and
simple private law dispute without any insignia of public element."
"the high court, therefore, was wrong in declaring the offending clause as arbitrary violating
article 14. it is true that the appellant is entitled to issue the policy applicable to a particular group
or class of lives entitled to avail contract of insurance with the appellant but a class or a group does
mean that the classification meets the demand of equality, fairness and justness. the doctrine of
classification is only a subsidiary rule evolved by the courts to give practical contend to the doctrine
of equality, over-emphasis on the doctrine of classification or anxious or sustained attempt to
discover some basis for classification may gradually and imperceptly erode the profound potency of
the glorious content of equality enshrined in article 14 of the constitution."
"confining the policy under table 58 to already covered salaried sections would,

development of law, held that an instrumentality of the state cannot impose
unconstitutional conditions in statutory rules vis-a-vis its employee to terminate the
service of a permanent employee in terms of the rules and held thus:
""should then our courts not advance with the times?"
"the
principle deducible from the above discussions on this part of the case is in
consonance with right and reason, intended to secure social and economic justice and
conforms to the mandate of the great equality clause in article 14. this principle is
that the courts will not enforce and will, when called upon to do so, strike an unfair
and unreasonable contract, or an unfair and unreasonable clause in a contract,
entered into between parties who are not equal in bargaining power. it is difficult to
give an exhaustive list of all bargains of this type."
"one can only attempt to give some
illustrations. for instance, the above principle will apply where the inequality of
bargaining power is the result of the great disparity in the economic strength of the
contracting parties. it will apply where the inequality is the result of circumstances,
whether of the creation of the parties or not."
"it will apply to situations in which the
speaker party is in a position in which he can obtain goods or services or means of
livelihood only upon the terms imposed by the stronger party or go without them. it
will also apply where a man has no choice, or rather no meaningful choice, but to give
his assent to a contract or to sign on the dotted line in a prescribed or standard form
or to accept a set of rules as part of the contract, however unfair, unreasonable and
unconscionable a clause in that contract or form or rules may be. this principle,
however, will not apply where the bargaining power of contracting parties is equal or
almost equal."

legal effect of the standard form of contracts is stated at page 1191 that if the presumption of
enforceability is retained, it threatens to continue generate undesirable results, thus :
""this expansion is made manifest by the explanatory comment, which states that
reason to believe that the adherent would not knowingly have singed may be inferred
from the fact that the term is bizarre or oppressive, from the fact that it eviscerates
the non-standard terms explicitly agreed to or from the fact that it eliminates the
dominant purpose of the transaction."""

""the problems in leff's and slawson's analyses are fundamental, and indeed would
seem to inhere in any attempt to justify from a public law perspective the proposition
that form terms have some initial, yet often defensible, validity."
"the supposed delegation is not based on any actual event, and considering
would run counter to basic public law notions : legitimate governmental bodies
should be disinterested in fact and should also be subject to role-defining rules and
rituals that encourage consideration of the public interest."" in chapter iv, ""toward the development of new doctrine"", at page 1249 he states that there exists :

disparity of economic resources) ought not to be a prerequisite to finding a contract

exercise of pre-existing market power."""

"all that is necessary is whether the presence of the correlative social role of the drafting party and

doctrine of unconscionability ""unjust in some sense"", etc., were considered and formulated
doctrines for applying the amended 211 restatement (second) of contracts. in his ""the bargain principle and its limits"" published in (1982) 95 har."

published in 1967) 115 u.pen. law review 485 at 494 stating that:
""the purpose of contract law is not simply to create conditions of liability, but also to
respond to the social process of promising."" he stated that since the law does not enforce a promise as such, a legal analysis of bargain of
promise must start with a question whether such promise is enforceable at all."
"quoting s.208 of the restatement (second) of contracts, he stated at page 752 that :
""over the last fifteen years, however, there have been strong indications that the
principle of unconscionability authorises a review of elements well beyond unfair
surprise, including, in appropriate cases, fairness of terms."" he further states that :
""theoretically it is possible for a contract to be oppressive taken as a whole, even
though there is no weakness in the bargaining process."" professor eisenberg propounds the basic test thus:l.i.c."

circumstances existing at the time of making of the contract - the principle is one of
the prevention of oppression and unfair surprise - and not of distrubance of
allocation of the risks because of superior bargaining power."" he further stated at page 799 that :
""over the past thirty years a new paradigmatic principle -
unconscionability - has emerged."
"in accomplishing this task, it now appears that the distinction
between procedural and substantive unconscionability, which may have served a
useful purpose at an earlier stage, does not provide much help once the relatively
obvious norms of unconscionability, such as unfair surprise, have been articulated. development of more specific norms must, instead, proceed by the identification of
classes of cases in which neither fairness nor efficiency supports the application of
the bargain principle - an effort that can be guided in part by the reconstruction and
extension of existing contract doctrines."" he concluded that :
""increase in the complexity of some areas of law may be desirable, if it accurately
mirrors the increased complexity of social and economic life."
