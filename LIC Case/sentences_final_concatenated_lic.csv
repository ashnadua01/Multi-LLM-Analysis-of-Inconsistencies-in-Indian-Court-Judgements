of respondents 2 to 5 were rejected as not being in conformity with the conditions prescribed in
Table 58, they cannot enforce any right flowing from Table 58 under Article 226. They cannot use
Judicial process to create rights in their favour unless a binding contract emerged by acceptance of
the proposal of insurance and acted upon. No rights would flow to any party to the proposal to

commercial contracts, in particular, after having recorded findings referred to hereinbefore in
favour of the corporation, the High Court committed error of law in declaring the offending portion
of the policy as arbitrary and violative of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. The actuarial principles are the calculations made by actuaries taking into consideration:
a) present condition of health and physical build of the life to be insured;
b) personal and family history, occupation, likelihood of any change in the
occupation etc."
"In the event of the said conversion, there is no need for fresh medical report. Since the policy
is commercial contract, the High Court has no power or jurisdiction to interfere with contractual
relations declaring them as invalid and unconstitutional. Shri Dhawan, learned Senior counsel for the respondents resisted these contentions on the anvil of
Article 25 of the Declaration of Human Rights, Article 7 of the International Covenant on Economic
and Social Rights and, in particular, on the provisions of Part III and the Directive Principles of the

unconstitutional conditions in the contract, no classification much less valid classification has been
made between salaried employees in Government, Semigovernment, organised sectors or reputed
commercial organisations, self-employed or unorganised sectors. The term insurance policy being
cheaper premium helps large segments of poor and lower middle class persons."
"In fact, this policy appears to be very

young person who is on the threshold of his career to provide maximum insurance
with a minimum cost and at the same time intended to offer a flexible contract which
can be altered into an endowment insurance without any need to pay premia after the
age of 70 and without further medical examination. Convertible term insurance is
designed to meet the needs of those who are initially unable to pay premium required
for whole life or endowment insurance policy and hope to be able to pay for such a
policy in the near future."
"The question is whether the term policy needs to be restricted only to the employees of Govt.,
quasi-government or reputed commercial firms and whether such condition is just, fair and
reasonable or based on reasonable classification consistent with Articles 14 and 21 of the
Constitution. The contention of the appellants is that life insurance policy being a contract of
insurance becomes a binding contract on appellants' acceptance. Until a contract is entered into, the

"Therefore, writ

money is assured on death (except death by accident only) or the happening of any contingency
dependent on human life, and any contract which subject to payment of premiums for a term

juncture that the insurer is free to evolve a policy based on business principles and conditions before
floating the policy to the general public offering on insurance of the life of the insured but as seen
earlier, the insurance being a social security measure, it should be consistent with the constitutional
animation and conscience of socioeconomic justice adumbrated in the Constitution as elucidated
hereinbefore."
"In M/s Erusian Equipment & Chemicals Ltd. v. State of West Bengal. 1975(1) SCC 70 at 75 in para

"When public

"The distinction between private law and public law remedy is now settled by this Court in LIC v.
Escorts Ltd., 1985 Supp. (3) SCR 909. by a Constitution Bench thus:-
""If the action of the State is related to contractual obligations arising out of the Court
(contract sic) the Court may not ordinarily examine unless the action has some public
law character attached to it. The Court will examine actions of State if they pertain to
the public law domain and refrain from examining them if they pertain to the private
law field."
"In that case when the
building owned by the port trust was exempted from the Rent Act, on terminating the tenancy for
development when possession was sought to be taken, it was challenged under Article 226 that the
action of the port trust was arbitrary and no public interest would be served by terminating the
tenancy. In that context, this Court held that even in contractual relations the Court cannot ignore
that the public authority must have constitutional conscience so that any interpretation put up must
be to avoid arbitrary action, lest the authority would be permitted to flourish as imperium a imperia. Whatever be the activity of the public authority, it must meet the test of Article 14 and judicial
review strikes an arbitrary action."
"Whatever be the activity of the public authority, it must meet the test of Article 14 and judicial
review strikes an arbitrary action. In Mahabir Auto Stores v. India Oil Corporation, AIR 1990 SC 1031, it was held that the State when
acting in its executive power, enters into contractual relations with the individual, Article 14 would
be applicable to the exercise of the power. The action of the State or its instrumentality can be
checked under Article 14."
"Their action must be subject to rule of law. If the governmental action
even in the matter of entering or not entering into contracts, fails to satisfy the test of
reasonableness, the same would be unreasonable. Rule of reason and rule against arbitrariness and
discrimination, rules of fair play, natural justice are part of the rule of law applicable in situation or
action by State/instrumentality in dealing with citizens."
"Rule of reason and rule against arbitrariness and
discrimination, rules of fair play, natural justice are part of the rule of law applicable in situation or
action by State/instrumentality in dealing with citizens. Even though the rights of the citizens,
therefore, are in the nature of contractual rights, the manner, the method and motive of a decision
of entering or not entering into a contract, are subject to judicial review on the touchstone of
relevance and reasonableness, fair play and natural justice, equality and non-discrimination. It isL.I.C."
"The
dichotomy between public law and private law rights and remedies, though may not be obliterated
by any straight jacket formula, it would depend upon the factual matrix. The adjudication of the
dispute arising out of a contract would, therefore, depend upon facts and circumstances in a given
case. The distinction between public law remedy and private law field cannot be demarcated with
precision."
"The distinction between public law and private law
remedy has now become too thin and practicably obliterated. In the sphere of contractual relations the State, its instrumentality, public authorities or those whose
acts bear insignia of public element, action to public duty or obligation are enjoined to act in a
manner i.e. fair, just and equitable, after taking objectively all the relevant options into
consideration and in a manner that is reasonable, relevant and germane to effectuate the purpose
for public good and in general public interest and it must not take any irrelevant or irrational factors
into consideration or arbitrary in its decision."
"The impact of every action is also on public
interest. It imposes public law obligation and impress with that character, the contracts made by the
State or its instrumentality. ""It is a different matter that the scope of judicial review in respect of
disputes falling within the domain of contractual obligations may be more limited and in doubtful
cases the parties may be relegated to the adjudication of their rights by resort to remedies provided

citizen may not by itself be a distinct enforceable right, but failure to consider and give due weight to

"The actions of the
State, its instrumentality, any public authority or person whose actions bear insignia of public law
element or public character are amendable to judicial review and the validity of such an action
would be tasted on the anvil of Article
14. While exercising the power under Article 226 the Court would be circumspect to adjudicate the
disputes arising out of the contract depending on the facts and circumstances in a given case. The
distinction between the public law remedy and private law field cannot be demarcated with
precision."
"The distinction between public law and private
law remedy is now narrowed down. The actions of the appellants bears public character with an
imprint of public interest element in their offers with terms and conditions mentioned in the
appropriate table inviting the public to enter into contract of life insurance. It is not a pure and
simple private law dispute without any insignia of public element."
"The High Court, therefore, was wrong in declaring the offending clause as arbitrary violating
Article 14. It is true that the appellant is entitled to issue the policy applicable to a particular group
or class of lives entitled to avail contract of insurance with the appellant but a class or a group does
mean that the classification meets the demand of equality, fairness and justness. The doctrine of
classification is only a subsidiary rule evolved by the courts to give practical contend to the doctrine
of equality, over-emphasis on the doctrine of classification or anxious or sustained attempt to
discover some basis for classification may gradually and imperceptly erode the profound potency of
the glorious content of equality enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution."
"Confining the policy under Table 58 to already covered salaried sections would,
therefore, be unreasonable and arbitrary and would deprive large segments in the rural areas or
unorganised or self- employed would be unjust and irrational and unfair. An unfair and untenable or irrational clause in a contract is also unjust amenable to judicial review. In common law a party was relieved from such contract."

development of law, held that an instrumentality of the State cannot impose
unconstitutional conditions in statutory rules vis-a-vis its employee to terminate the
service of a permanent employee in terms of the rules and held thus:
""Should then our courts not advance with the times?"
"The
principle deducible from the above discussions on this part of the case is in
consonance with right and reason, intended to secure social and economic justice and
conforms to the mandate of the great equality clause in article 14. This principle is
that the courts will not enforce and will, when called upon to do so, strike an unfair
and unreasonable contract, or an unfair and unreasonable clause in a contract,
entered into between parties who are not equal in bargaining power. It is difficult to
give an exhaustive list of all bargains of this type."
"One can only attempt to give some
illustrations. For instance, the above principle will apply where the inequality of
bargaining power is the result of the great disparity in the economic strength of the
contracting parties. It will apply where the inequality is the result of circumstances,
whether of the creation of the parties or not."
"It will apply to situations in which the
speaker party is in a position in which he can obtain goods or services or means of
livelihood only upon the terms imposed by the stronger party or go without them. It
will also apply where a man has no choice, or rather no meaningful choice, but to give
his assent to a contract or to sign on the dotted line in a prescribed or standard form
or to accept a set of rules as part of the contract, however unfair, unreasonable and
unconscionable a clause in that contract or form or rules may be. This principle,
however, will not apply where the bargaining power of contracting parties is equal or
almost equal."

""In the last decade or two, courts analyzing contracts of adhesion have applied the
categories of public interest and superior bargaining power to a substantially broader
set of situations than would fit within the analogous doctrines of ordinary contract
law concerning business affected with a public interest and transactions tainted by
economic duress."

""The problems in Leff's and Slawson's analyses are fundamental, and indeed would
seem to inhere in any attempt to justify from a public law perspective the proposition
that form terms have some initial, yet often defensible, validity."
"The supposed delegation is not based on any actual event, and considering
would run counter to basic public law notions : legitimate governmental bodies
should be disinterested in fact and should also be subject to role-defining rules and
rituals that encourage consideration of the public interest."" In Chapter IV, ""Toward the Development of New Doctrine"", at page 1249 he states that there exists :
""Gross inequality of bargaining power"" or the like (in the usual sense of a wide
disparity of economic resources) ought not to be a prerequisite to finding a contract
of adhesion. Put simply, the practice of standard form contracting is not based on the
exercise of pre-existing market power."""

"Eisenberg quotes Prof. Arthur Leff from the latter's article ""Unconscionability of the Code""
published in 1967) 115 U.Pen. Law Review 485 at 494 stating that:
""The purpose of contract law is not simply to create conditions of liability, but also to
respond to the social process of promising."" He stated that since the law does not enforce a promise as such, a legal analysis of bargain of
promise must start with a question whether such promise is enforceable at all."
"Quoting S.208 of the Restatement (second) of Contracts, he stated at page 752 that :
""Over the last fifteen years, however, there have been strong indications that the
principle of unconscionability authorises a review of elements well beyond unfair
surprise, including, in appropriate cases, fairness of terms."" He further states that :
""Theoretically it is possible for a contract to be oppressive taken as a whole, even
though there is no weakness in the bargaining process."" Professor Eisenberg propounds the basic test thus:L.I.C."

circumstances existing at the time of making of the contract - The principle is one of
the prevention of oppression and unfair surprise - and not of distrubance of
allocation of the risks because of superior bargaining power."" He further stated at page 799 that :
""Over the past thirty years a new paradigmatic principle -
unconscionability - has emerged."
"In accomplishing this task, it now appears that the distinction
between procedural and substantive unconscionability, which may have served a
useful purpose at an earlier stage, does not provide much help once the relatively
obvious norms of unconscionability, such as unfair surprise, have been articulated. Development of more specific norms must, instead, proceed by the identification of
classes of cases in which neither fairness nor efficiency supports the application of
the bargain principle - an effort that can be guided in part by the reconstruction and
extension of existing contract doctrines."" He concluded that :
""Increase in the complexity of some areas of law may be desirable, if it accurately
mirrors the increased complexity of social and economic life."
