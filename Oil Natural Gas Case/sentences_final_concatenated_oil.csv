J U D G M E N T Shah, J. COURT'S JURISDICTION UNDER SECTION 34 OF THE ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION
ACT, 1966 Before dealing with the issues involved in this appeal, we would first decide the main
point in controversy, namely - the ambit and scope of Court's jurisdiction in case where award
passed by the Arbitral Tribunal is challenged under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Act"") as the decision in this appeal would depend upon the
said finding. In other words - whether the Court would have jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Act
to set aside an award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal which is patently illegal or in contravention of
the provisions of the Act or any other substantive law governing the parties or is against the terms of
the contract?Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd vs Saw Pipes Ltd on 17 April, 2003

jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Act. Mr. Dushyant Dave, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondent - company submitted
to the contrary and contended that the Court's jurisdiction under Section 34 is limited and the
award could be set aside mainly on the ground that the same is in conflict with the 'Public Policy of
India'."
"For deciding this controversy, we would refer to the relevant part of Section 34 which reads as

the scope of the submission to arbitration;
Provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not
so submitted, only that part of the arbitral award which contains decisions on matters not submitted
to arbitration may be set aside; or

(iv) any other expenses incurred in connection with the arbitral proceedings and the arbitral award."" The aforesaid provisions prescribe the procedure to be followed by the arbitral tribunal coupled with
its powers. Power and procedure are synonymous in the present case."
"Power and procedure are synonymous in the present case. By prescribing the procedure,
the arbitral tribunal is empowered and is required to decide the dispute in accordance with the
provisions of the Act, that is to say, the jurisdiction of the tribunal to decide the dispute is
prescribed. In these sections there is no distinction between the jurisdiction/power and the
procedure."
"We are of opinion
that there is no substance in the contention either."" Hence, the jurisdiction or the power of the arbitral tribunal is prescribed under the Act and if the
award is de hors the said provisions, it would be, on the face of it, illegal. The decision of the
Tribunal must be within the bounds of its jurisdiction conferred under the Act or the contract."
"The decision of the
Tribunal must be within the bounds of its jurisdiction conferred under the Act or the contract. In
exercising jurisdiction, the arbitral tribunal can not act in breach of some provision of substantive
law or the provisions of the Act. The question, therefore, which requires consideration is - whether the award could be set aside, if
the arbitral tribunal has not followed the mandatory procedure prescribed under Sections 24, 28 or
31(3), which affects the rights of the parties?"
"In

the arbitral tribunal has not followed the mandatory procedure prescribed under Sections 24, 28 or
31(3), which affects the rights of the parties? Under sub-section (1)(a) of Section 28 there is a
mandate to the arbitral tribunal to decide the dispute in accordance with the substantive law for the
time being in force in India."
"The question, therefore, which requires consideration is - whether the award could be set aside, if
the arbitral tribunal has not followed the mandatory procedure prescribed under Sections 24, 28 or
31(3), which affects the rights of the parties? Under sub-section (1)(a) of Section 28 there is a
mandate to the arbitral tribunal to decide the dispute in accordance with the substantive law for the
time being in force in India. Admittedly, substantive law would include the Indian Contract Act, the
Transfer of Property Act and other such laws in force."
"Suppose, if the award is passed in violation of
the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act or in violation of the Indian Contract Act, the question
would be - whether such award could be set aside? Similarly, under sub-section (3), arbitral tribunal
is directed to decide the dispute in accordance with the terms of the contract and also after taking
into account the usage of the trade applicable to the transaction. If arbitral tribunal ignores the
terms of the contract or usage of the trade applicable to the transaction, whether the said award
could be interfered?"
"Similarly, under sub-section (3), arbitral tribunal
is directed to decide the dispute in accordance with the terms of the contract and also after taking
into account the usage of the trade applicable to the transaction. If arbitral tribunal ignores the
terms of the contract or usage of the trade applicable to the transaction, whether the said award
could be interfered? Similarly, if the award is non-speaking one and is in violation of Section 31(3),
can such award be set aside?"
"If it is held that such award
could not be interfered, it would be contrary to basic concept of justice. If the arbitral tribunal has
not followed the mandatory procedure prescribed under the Act, it would mean that it has acted
beyond its jurisdiction and thereby the award would be patently illegal which could be set aside
under Section 34. The aforesaid interpretation of the clause (v) would be in conformity with the settled principle of law
that the procedural law cannot fail to provide relief when substantive law gives the right."
"WHAT MEANING COULD BE ASSIGNED TO THE PHRASE 'PUBLIC POLICY OF INDIA'? The next clause which requires interpretation is clause (ii) of sub-section 2(b) of Section 34 which
inter alia provides that the Court may set aside arbitral award if it is in conflict with the 'Public
Policy of India'. The phrase 'Public Policy of India' is not defined under the Act."
"It was not a case where validity of the Award is challenged
before a forum prescribed under the Act. He submitted that the scheme of Section 34 which deals
with setting aside the domestic arbitral award and Section 48 which deals with enforcement of
foreign award are not identical. A foreign award by definition is subject to double exequatur."
"Therefore, in a case where the
validity of award is challenged there is no necessity of giving a narrower meaning to the term 'public
policy of India'. On the contrary, wider meaning is required to be given so that the 'patently illegal
award' passed by the arbitral tribunal could be set aside. If narrow meaning as contended by the
learned senior counsel Mr. Dave is given, some of the provisions of the Arbitration Act would
become nugatory."
"If narrow meaning as contended by the
learned senior counsel Mr. Dave is given, some of the provisions of the Arbitration Act would
become nugatory. Take for illustration a case wherein there is a specific provision in the contract
that for delayed payment of the amount due and payable, no interest would be payable, still
however, if the Arbitrator has passed an award granting interest, it would be against the terms of the
contract and thereby against the provision of Section 28(3) of the Act which specifically provides
that ""arbitral tribunal shall decide in accordance with the terms of the contract"". Further, where
there is a specific usage of the trade that if the payment is made beyond a period of one month, then
the party would be required to pay the said amount with interest at the rate of 15 per cent."
"In all such cases, the award is required to be
set aside on the ground of 'patent illegality'. The learned senior counsel Mr. Dave submitted that the Parliament has not made much change
while adopting Article 34 of UNCITRAL Model Law by not providing error of law as a ground ofOil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd vs Saw Pipes Ltd on 17 April, 2003

68, 69 and 70 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 applicable in England and submitted that if the legislature
wanted to give a wider jurisdiction to the Court, it would have done so by adopting similar
provisions."
"Section 68 reads thus: -
""68. Challenging the award: serious irregularity-
(1) A party to arbitral proceedings may (upon notice to the other parties and to the
tribunal) apply to the court challenging an award in the proceedings on the ground of
serious irregularity affecting the tribunal, the proceedings or the award. A party may lose the right to object (see Section 73) and the right to apply is subject to the
restrictions in section 70(2) and (3)."
"A party may lose the right to object (see Section 73) and the right to apply is subject to the
restrictions in section 70(2) and (3). (2) Serious irregularity means an irregularity of one or more of the following kinds which the court

(a) failure by the tribunal to comply with section 33 (general duty of tribunal);
(b) the tribunal exceeding its powers (otherwise than by exceeding its substantive jurisdiction: see
section 67);
(c) failure by the tribunal to conduct the proceedings in accordance with the procedure agreed by the
parties;

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/919241/ 13(3) If there is shown to be serious irregularity affecting the tribunal, the proceedings or the award,
the court may-
(a) remit the award to the tribunal, in whole or in part, for reconsideration;
(b) set the award aside in whole or in part, or
(c) declare the award to be of no effect, in whole or in part. The Court shall not exercise its power to set aside or to declare an award to be of no effect, in whole
or in part, unless it is satisfied that it would be inappropriate to remit the matters in question to the
tribunal for reconsideration."
"Section 70 provides supplementary provisions. It is true that Legislature has not incorporated exhaustive grounds for challenging the award passed
by the arbitral tribunal or the ground on which appeal against the order of the Court would be
maintainable. On this aspect, eminent Jurist & Senior Advocate Late Mr. Nani Palkhivala while giving his opinion
to 'Law of Arbitration and Conciliation' by Justice Dr. B.P."
"I welcome your view on the need for giving the doctrine of ""public policy"" its full
amplitude. I particularly endorse your comment that Courts of law may intervene to
permit challenge to an arbitral award which is based on an irregularity of a kind
which has caused substantial injustice. If the arbitral tribunal does not dispense justice, it cannot truly be reflective of an
alternate dispute resolution mechanism."
"I particularly endorse your comment that Courts of law may intervene to
permit challenge to an arbitral award which is based on an irregularity of a kind
which has caused substantial injustice. If the arbitral tribunal does not dispense justice, it cannot truly be reflective of an
alternate dispute resolution mechanism. Hence, if the award has resulted in an
injustice, a Court would be well within its right in upholding the challenge to the
award on the ground that it is in conflict with the public policy of India."
"Hence, the award which is
passed in contravention of Sections 24, 28 or 31 could be set aside. In addition to Section 34, Section
13(5) of the Act also provides that constitution of the arbitral tribunal could also be challenged by a
party. Similarly, Section 16 provides that a party aggrieved by the decision of the arbitral tribunal
with regard to its jurisdiction could challenge such arbitral award under Section 34."
"In addition to Section 34, Section
13(5) of the Act also provides that constitution of the arbitral tribunal could also be challenged by a
party. Similarly, Section 16 provides that a party aggrieved by the decision of the arbitral tribunal
with regard to its jurisdiction could challenge such arbitral award under Section 34. In any case, it is
for the Parliament to provide for limited or wider jurisdiction to the Court in case where award is
challenged."
"Learned senior counsel Mr. Dave submitted that the purpose of giving limited jurisdiction to the
Court is obvious and is to see that the disputes are resolved at the earliest by giving finality to the
award passed by the forum chosen by the parties. As against this, learned senior counsel Mr. Desai
submitted that in the present system even the arbitral proceedings are delayed on one or the other
ground including the ground that the arbitrator is not free and the matters are not disposed of for
months together. He submitted that the legislature has not provided any time limit for passing of the
award and this indicates that the contention raised by the learned counsel for the respondent has no
bearing in interpreting Section 34."
"It is also true that on occasions, arbitration proceedings are delayed for one or
other reason, but it is for the parties to take appropriate action of selecting proper arbitrator(s) who
could dispose of the matter within reasonable time fixed by them. It is for them to indicate the time
limit for disposal of the arbitral proceedings. It is for them to decide whether they should continue
with the arbitrator(s) who cannot dispose of the matter within reasonable time."
"Such award is opposed to public policy and
is required to be adjudged void. NOW ON FACTS:-
The brief facts of the case are as under:-
Appellant - ONGC which is a Public Sector Undertaking, has challenged the arbitral
award dated 2nd May, 1999 by filing Arbitration Petition No. 917/1999 before the
High Court of Bombay."
"It is the contention of the respondent that the
appellant made payment of the goods supplied after wrongfully deducting an amount
of US $ 3,04,970.20 and Rs.15,75,559/- as liquidated damages. That deduction was
disputed by the respondent and, therefore, dispute was referred to the arbitral
tribunal. The arbitral tribunal arrived at the conclusion that strikes affecting the
supply of raw material to the claimant are not within the definition of 'Force Majeure'
in the contract between the parties, and hence, on that ground, it cannot be said that
the amount of liquidated damages was wrongfully withheld by the appellant."

regard to other contention on the basis of customs duty also, the arbitral tribunal
arrived at the conclusion that it would not justify the delay in the supply of goods."

conclusion that in view of the statement volunteered by Mr. Arumoy Das, it was clear
that shortage of casing pipes was only one of the other reasons which led to the
change in the deployment plan and that it has failed to establish its case that it has
suffered any loss in terms of money because of delay in supply of goods under the
contract."

contract provisions of Section 74 of the Contract Act would be applicable and compensation /
damages could be awarded only if the loss is suffered because of the breach of contract."
"{Re:
Provash Chandra Dalui and another v. Biswanath Banerjee and another [1989 Supp
(1) SCC 487]}. Therefore, when parties have expressly agreed that recovery from the contractor for
breach of the contract is pre-estimated genuine liquidated damages and is not by way
of penalty duly agreed by the parties, there was no justifiable reason for the arbitral
tribunal to arrive at a conclusion that still the purchaser should prove loss suffered by
it because of delay in supply of goods. Further, in arbitration proceedings, the arbitral tribunal is required to decide the
dispute in accordance with the terms of the contract."

contractor fails to deliver the stores within the stipulated time, appellant will be
entitled to recover from the contractor, as agreed, liquidated damages equivalent to
1% of the contract price of the whole unit per week for such delay."
"In the light of the aforesaid decisions, in our view, there is much force in the contention raised by
the learned counsel for the appellant. However, the learned senior counsel Mr. Dave submitted that
even if the award passed by the arbitral tribunal is erroneous, it is settled law that when two views
are possible with regard to interpretation of statutory provisions and or facts, the Court would
refuse to interfere with such award. It is true that if the arbitral tribunal has committed mere error of fact or law in reaching its
conclusion on the disputed question submitted to it for adjudication then the Court would have no
jurisdiction to interfere with the award."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/919241/ 24settled law that in a case of reasoned award, the Court can set aside the same if it is, on the face of it,
erroneous on the proposition of law or its application; (c) If a specific question of law is submitted to
the arbitrator, erroneous decision in point of law does not make the award bad, so as to permit of its
being set aside, unless the Court is satisfied that the arbitrator had proceeded illegally."
"In the facts of the case, it cannot be disputed that if contractual term, as it is, is to be taken into
consideration, the award is, on the face of it, erroneous and in violation of the terms of the contract
and thereby it violates Section 28(3) of the Act. Undisputedly, reference to the arbitral tribunal was
not with regard to interpretation of question of law. It was only a general reference with regard to
claim of respondent."
"Next question is - whether the legal proposition which is the basis of the award for arriving at the
conclusion that ONGC was not entitled to recover the stipulated liquidated damages as it has failed
to establish that it has suffered any loss is erroneous on the face of it? The arbitral tribunal after
considering the decisions rendered by this Court in the cases of Fateh Chand, Maula Bux and
Rampur Distillery (supra) arrived at the conclusion that ""in view of these three decisions of the
Supreme Court, it is clear that it was for the respondents to establish that they had suffered any loss
because of the breach committed by the claimant in the supply of goods under the contract between
the parties after 14th November, 1996. In the words we have emphasized in Maula Bux decision, it is
clear that if loss in terms of money can be determined, the party claiming the compensation 'must

are required to consider is whether the respondents have established their case of actual loss in
money terms because of the delay in the supply of the Casing Pipes under the contract between the
parties"". Finally, the arbitral tribunal held that as the appellant has failed to prove the loss suffered

Sections 73 and 74 of the Indian Contract Act and the ratio laid down in Fateh Chand's case (supra)
wherein it is specifically held that jurisdiction of the Court to award compensation in case of breach
of contract is unqualified except as to the maximum stipulated; and compensation has to be

breach is entitled to receive compensation for any loss caused to him which the parties knew when
they made the contract to be likely to result from the breach of it."
"It is
undoubtedly true that the witness has stated that redeployment plan was made keeping in mind
several constraints including shortage of casing pipes. Arbitral Tribunal, therefore, took into
consideration the aforesaid statement volunteered by the witness that shortage of casing pipes was
only one of the several reasons and not the only reason which led to change in deployment of plan or
redeployment of rigs Trident-II platform B-121. In our view, in such a contract, it would be difficult
to prove exact loss or damage which the parties suffer because of the breach thereof."
"As the award directing the appellant to refund the amount deducted is set aside, question of
granting interest on the same would not arise. Still however, to demonstrate that the award passed
by the arbitral tribunal is, on the face of it, erroneous with regard to grant of interest, we deal with
the same.Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd vs Saw Pipes Ltd on 17 April, 2003
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/919241/ 30Arbitral Tribunal arrived at the conclusion that the appellant wrongfully withheld/deducted the
aggregate amount of US $ 3,04,970.20 on account of delay in supply of goods and amount of
Rs.15,75,559/- on account of excise duty, sales tax, freight charges deducted as and by way of
liquidated damages from the amount payable by the respondent and thereafter arrived at the
conclusion that the said amount was deducted from undisputed invoice amount, therefore, the said
claim of the respondent cannot be held to be 'disputed claim'. It is apparent that the claim of the contractor to recover the said amount was disputed mainly
because it was agreed term between the parties that in case of delay in supply of goods appellant was
entitled to recover damages at the rate as specified in the agreement."
"In such case, the interest
rate is also specified at 1% per month on such undisputed claim amount. Despite this clause, the
arbitral tribunal came to the conclusion that it was undisputed claim and held that in law, appellant
was not entitled to withhold these two payments from the invoice raised by the respondent and
hence directed that the appellant was liable to pay interest on wrongful deductions at the rate of 12%
p.a. from 1.4.1997 till the date of filing of the statement of claim and thereafter having regard to the
commercial nature of the transaction at the rate of 18% p.a."
"It is to be reiterated that it is the primary duty of the arbitrators to enforce a promise which the
parties have made and to uphold the sanctity of the contract which forms the basis of the civilized
society and also the jurisdiction of the arbitrators. Hence, this part of the award passed by the
arbitral tribunal granting interest on the amount deducted by the appellant from the bills payable to
the respondent is against the terms of the contract and is, therefore, violative of Section 28(3) of the
Act. CONCLUSIONS:-
