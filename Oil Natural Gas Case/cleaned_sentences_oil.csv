"power and procedure are synonymous in the present case. by prescribing the procedure,
the arbitral tribunal is empowered and is required to decide the dispute in accordance with the
provisions of the act, that is to say, the jurisdiction of the tribunal to decide the dispute is
prescribed. in these sections there is no distinction between the jurisdiction/power and the
procedure."
"we are of opinion
that there is no substance in the contention either."" hence, the jurisdiction or the power of the arbitral tribunal is prescribed under the act and if the
award is de hors the said provisions, it would be, on the face of it, illegal. the decision of the
tribunal must be within the bounds of its jurisdiction conferred under the act or the contract."
"the decision of the
tribunal must be within the bounds of its jurisdiction conferred under the act or the contract. in
exercising jurisdiction, the arbitral tribunal can not act in breach of some provision of substantive
law or the provisions of the act. the question, therefore, which requires consideration is - whether the award could be set aside, if
the arbitral tribunal has not followed the mandatory procedure prescribed under sections 24, 28 or

the arbitral tribunal has not followed the mandatory procedure prescribed under sections 24, 28 or
31(3), which affects the rights of the parties? under sub-section (1)(a) of section 28 there is a
mandate to the arbitral tribunal to decide the dispute in accordance with the substantive law for the
time being in force in india."
"the question, therefore, which requires consideration is - whether the award could be set aside, if
the arbitral tribunal has not followed the mandatory procedure prescribed under sections 24, 28 or
31(3), which affects the rights of the parties? under sub-section (1)(a) of section 28 there is a
mandate to the arbitral tribunal to decide the dispute in accordance with the substantive law for the
time being in force in india. admittedly, substantive law would include the indian contract act, the
transfer of property act and other such laws in force."
"suppose, if the award is passed in violation of
the provisions of the transfer of property act or in violation of the indian contract act, the question
would be - whether such award could be set aside? similarly, under sub-section (3), arbitral tribunal
is directed to decide the dispute in accordance with the terms of the contract and also after taking
into account the usage of the trade applicable to the transaction. if arbitral tribunal ignores the
terms of the contract or usage of the trade applicable to the transaction, whether the said award
could be interfered?"
"similarly, under sub-section (3), arbitral tribunal
is directed to decide the dispute in accordance with the terms of the contract and also after taking
into account the usage of the trade applicable to the transaction. if arbitral tribunal ignores the
terms of the contract or usage of the trade applicable to the transaction, whether the said award
could be interfered? similarly, if the award is non-speaking one and is in violation of section 31(3),
can such award be set aside?"
"if it is held that such award
could not be interfered, it would be contrary to basic concept of justice. if the arbitral tribunal has
not followed the mandatory procedure prescribed under the act, it would mean that it has acted
beyond its jurisdiction and thereby the award would be patently illegal which could be set aside
under section 34. the aforesaid interpretation of the clause (v) would be in conformity with the settled principle of law
that the procedural law cannot fail to provide relief when substantive law gives the right."
"what meaning could be assigned to the phrase 'public policy of india'? the next clause which requires interpretation is clause (ii) of sub-section 2(b) of section 34 which
inter alia provides that the court may set aside arbitral award if it is in conflict with the 'public
policy of india'. the phrase 'public policy of india' is not defined under the act."
"it was not a case where validity of the award is challenged
before a forum prescribed under the act. he submitted that the scheme of section 34 which deals
with setting aside the domestic arbitral award and section 48 which deals with enforcement of
foreign award are not identical. a foreign award by definition is subject to double exequatur."
"therefore, in a case where the
validity of award is challenged there is no necessity of giving a narrower meaning to the term 'public
policy of india'. on the contrary, wider meaning is required to be given so that the 'patently illegal
award' passed by the arbitral tribunal could be set aside. if narrow meaning as contended by the
learned senior counsel mr. dave is given, some of the provisions of the arbitration act would
become nugatory."
"if narrow meaning as contended by the
learned senior counsel mr. dave is given, some of the provisions of the arbitration act would
become nugatory. take for illustration a case wherein there is a specific provision in the contract
that for delayed payment of the amount due and payable, no interest would be payable, still
however, if the arbitrator has passed an award granting interest, it would be against the terms of the
contract and thereby against the provision of section 28(3) of the act which specifically provides
that ""arbitral tribunal shall decide in accordance with the terms of the contract"". further, where
there is a specific usage of the trade that if the payment is made beyond a period of one month, then
the party would be required to pay the said amount with interest at the rate of 15 per cent."
"in all such cases, the award is required to be
set aside on the ground of 'patent illegality'. the learned senior counsel mr. dave submitted that the parliament has not made much change
while adopting article 34 of uncitral model law by not providing error of law as a ground ofoil & natural gas corporation ltd vs saw pipes ltd on 17 april, 2003

68, 69 and 70 of the arbitration act, 1996 applicable in england and submitted that if the legislature
wanted to give a wider jurisdiction to the court, it would have done so by adopting similar
provisions."
"section 68 reads thus: -

the court may-
(a) remit the award to the tribunal, in whole or in part, for reconsideration;

(c) declare the award to be of no effect, in whole or in part. the court shall not exercise its power to set aside or to declare an award to be of no effect, in whole

"section 70 provides supplementary provisions. it is true that legislature has not incorporated exhaustive grounds for challenging the award passed
by the arbitral tribunal or the ground on which appeal against the order of the court would be
maintainable. on this aspect, eminent jurist & senior advocate late mr. nani palkhivala while giving his opinion
to 'law of arbitration and conciliation' by justice dr. b.p."
"i welcome your view on the need for giving the doctrine of ""public policy"" its full
amplitude. i particularly endorse your comment that courts of law may intervene to
permit challenge to an arbitral award which is based on an irregularity of a kind
which has caused substantial injustice. if the arbitral tribunal does not dispense justice, it cannot truly be reflective of an
alternate dispute resolution mechanism."

award on the ground that it is in conflict with the public policy of india."
"hence, the award which is
passed in contravention of sections 24, 28 or 31 could be set aside. in addition to section 34, section
13(5) of the act also provides that constitution of the arbitral tribunal could also be challenged by a
party. similarly, section 16 provides that a party aggrieved by the decision of the arbitral tribunal
with regard to its jurisdiction could challenge such arbitral award under section 34."

for the parliament to provide for limited or wider jurisdiction to the court in case where award is
challenged."
"learned senior counsel mr. dave submitted that the purpose of giving limited jurisdiction to the
court is obvious and is to see that the disputes are resolved at the earliest by giving finality to the
award passed by the forum chosen by the parties. as against this, learned senior counsel mr. desai
submitted that in the present system even the arbitral proceedings are delayed on one or the other
ground including the ground that the arbitrator is not free and the matters are not disposed of for
months together. he submitted that the legislature has not provided any time limit for passing of the
award and this indicates that the contention raised by the learned counsel for the respondent has no
bearing in interpreting section 34."
"it is also true that on occasions, arbitration proceedings are delayed for one or
other reason, but it is for the parties to take appropriate action of selecting proper arbitrator(s) who
could dispose of the matter within reasonable time fixed by them. it is for them to indicate the time
limit for disposal of the arbitral proceedings. it is for them to decide whether they should continue
with the arbitrator(s) who cannot dispose of the matter within reasonable time."
"such award is opposed to public policy and
is required to be adjudged void. now on facts:-
the brief facts of the case are as under:-
appellant - ongc which is a public sector undertaking, has challenged the arbitral
award dated 2nd may, 1999 by filing arbitration petition no. 917/1999 before the
high court of bombay."
"it is the contention of the respondent that the
appellant made payment of the goods supplied after wrongfully deducting an amount
of us $ 3,04,970.20 and rs.15,75,559/- as liquidated damages. that deduction was
disputed by the respondent and, therefore, dispute was referred to the arbitral
tribunal. the arbitral tribunal arrived at the conclusion that strikes affecting the
supply of raw material to the claimant are not within the definition of 'force majeure'
in the contract between the parties, and hence, on that ground, it cannot be said that
the amount of liquidated damages was wrongfully withheld by the appellant."

breach of the contract is pre-estimated genuine liquidated damages and is not by way
of penalty duly agreed by the parties, there was no justifiable reason for the arbitral
tribunal to arrive at a conclusion that still the purchaser should prove loss suffered by
it because of E11 further, in arbitration proceedings, the arbitral tribunal is required to decide the

conclusion that ongc was not entitled to recover the stipulated liquidated damages as it has failed
to establish that it has suffered any loss is erroneous on the face of it? the arbitral tribunal after

liquidated damages from the amount payable by the respondent and thereafter arrived at the
conclusion that the said amount was deducted from undisputed invoice amount, therefore, the said
claim of the respondent cannot be held to be 'disputed claim'. it is apparent that the claim of the contractor to recover the said amount was disputed mainly
because it was agreed term between the parties that in case of E11 appellant was
entitled to recover damages at the rate as specified in the agreement."

rate is also specified at 1% per month on such undisputed claim amount. despite this clause, the
arbitral tribunal came to the conclusion that it was undisputed claim and held that in law, appellant
