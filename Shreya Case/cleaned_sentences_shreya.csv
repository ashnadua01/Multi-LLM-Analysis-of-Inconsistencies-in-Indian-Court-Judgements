"4. the petitioners contend that the very basis of section 66a - that it has given rise to new forms of
crimes - is incorrect, and that sections 66b to 67c and various sections of the indian penal code
(which will be referred to hereinafter) are good enough to deal with all these crimes. 5."

"mere possibility of abuse of a provision cannot be a ground to declare a
provision invalid. loose language may have been used in section 66a to deal with novel methods of
disturbing other people's rights by using the internet as a tool to do so. further, vagueness is not a
ground to declare a statute unconstitutional if the statute is otherwise legislatively competent and
non-arbitrary."
"a. article 19(1)(a) -
section 66a has been challenged on the ground that it casts the net very wide - ""all information"" that
is disseminated over the internet is included within its reach. it will be useful to note that section

"in fact, it refers only to the medium
through which such information is disseminated. it is clear, therefore, that the petitioners are
correct in saying that the public's right to know is directly affected by section 66a. information of all
kinds is roped in - such information may have scientific, literary or artistic value, it may refer to
current events, it may be obscene or seditious."
"that such information may cause annoyance or
inconvenience to some is how the offence is made out. it is clear that the right of the people to know
- the market place of ideas - which the internet provides to persons of all kinds is what attracts
section 66a. that the information sent has to be annoying, inconvenient, grossly offensive etc., also
shows that no distinction is made between mere discussion or advocacy of a particular point of view
which may be annoying or inconvenient or grossly offensive to some and incitement by which such
words lead to an imminent causal connection with public disorder, security of state etc."

petitioners are right in saying that section 66a in creating an offence against persons who use the
internet and annoy or cause inconvenience to others very clearly affects the freedom of speech and
expression of the citizenry of india at large in that such speech or expression is directly curbed by
the creation of the offence contained in section 66a. in this regard, the observations of justice jackson in american communications association v.

"but we do not find anything in the features outlined by the
learned additional solicitor general to relax the court's scrutiny of the curbing of the content of free
speech over the internet. while it may be possible to narrowly draw a section creating a new offence,
such as section 69a for instance, relatable only to speech over the internet, yet the validity of such a
law will have to be tested on the touchstone of the tests already indicated above. 29."
"in article 19(2) (as it originally stood) this sub-head was conspicuously absent. because of its
absence, challenges made to an order made under section 7 of the punjab maintenance of public
order act and to an order made under section 9 (1)(a) of the madras maintenance of public order
act were allowed in two early judgments by this court. thus in romesh thappar v. state of madras,
[1950] s.c.r."
"thus in romesh thappar v. state of madras,
[1950] s.c.r. 594, this court held that an order made under section 9(1)(a) of the madras
maintenance of public order act (xxiii of 1949) was unconstitutional and void in that it could not
be justified as a measure connected with security of the state. while dealing with the expression
""public order"", this court held that ""public order"" is an expression which signifies a state of
tranquility which prevails amongst the members of a political society as a result of the internal
regulations enforced by the government which they have established."
"v. state of delhi, [1950] s.c.r. 605, an order made under
section 7 of the east punjab public safety act, T12 was held to be unconstitutional and void for the
self-same reason. 32."
"this is an act of a very different sort. its
implications are deeper and it affects the even tempo of life and public order is
jeopardized because the repercussions of the act embrace large sections of the
community and incite them to make further breaches of the law and order and to
subvert the public order. an act by itself is not determinant of its own gravity."
"we have to ask
ourselves the question: does a particular act lead to disturbance of the current life of the community
or does it merely affect an individual leaving the tranquility of society undisturbed? going by this
test, it is clear that section 66a is intended to punish any person who uses the internet to
A11 that falls within the sub-clauses of section 66a. it will be immediately
noticed that the recipient of the written word that is sent by the person who is accused of the offence
is not of any importance so far as this section is concerned."
"going by this
test, it is clear that section 66a is intended to punish any person who uses the internet to

noticed that the recipient of the written word that is sent by the person who is accused of the offence
is not of any importance so far as this section is concerned. (save and except where under
sub-clause (c) the addressee or recipient is deceived or misled about the origin of a particular
message.)"
"it is clear, therefore, that the information that is disseminated may be to one individual or
several individuals. the section makes no distinction between mass dissemination and
dissemination to one person. further, the section does not require that such message should have a
clear tendency to disrupt public order."
"the section makes no distinction between mass dissemination and
dissemination to one person. further, the section does not require that such message should have a
clear tendency to disrupt public order. such message need not have any potential which could
disturb the community at large."
"the nexus between the message and action that may be taken based
on the message is conspicuously absent - there is no ingredient in this offence of inciting anybody to
do anything which a reasonable man would then say would have the tendency of being an immediate
threat to public safety or tranquility. on all these counts, it is clear that the section has no proximate
relationship to public order whatsoever. the example of a guest at a hotel `annoying' girls is telling -
this court has held that mere `annoyance' need not cause disturbance of public order."
"the example of a guest at a hotel `annoying' girls is telling -
this court has held that mere `annoyance' need not cause disturbance of public order. under
section 66a, the offence is complete by sending a message for the purpose of causing annoyance,
either `persistently' or otherwise without in any manner impacting public order. clear and present danger - tendency to affect."
"in ramji lal modi v. the state of u.p., [1957] s.c.r. 860 at page 867, this court upheld section
295a of the indian penal code only because it was read down to mean that aggravated forms of
insults to religion must have a tendency to disrupt public order. similarly, in kedar nath singh v.
state of bihar, T7 supp."
"(2) s.c.r. 769, section 124a of the indian penal code was upheld by
construing it narrowly and stating that the offence would only be complete if the words complained
of have a tendency of creating public disorder by violence. it was added that merely creatingshreya singhal vs u.o.i on 24 march, T27
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110813550/ 19disaffection or creating feelings of enmity in certain people was not good enough or else it would

prabhoo v. prabhakar kashinath kunte & ors., T25 (1) scc 130, section 123 (3a) of the
representation of people act was upheld only if the enmity or hatred that was spoken about in the
section would tend to create immediate public disorder and not otherwise. 41."
"41. viewed at either by the standpoint of the clear and present danger test or the tendency to create
public disorder, section 66a would not pass muster as it has no element of any tendency to create
public disorder which ought to be an essential ingredient of the offence which it creates. defamation
42."
"defamation
42. defamation is defined in section 499 of the penal code as follows:
""499. defamation.-whoever, by words either spoken or intended to be read, or by
signs or by visible representations, makes or publishes any imputation concerning
any person intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such
imputation will harm, the reputation of such person, is said, except in the cases
hereinafter excepted, to defame that person."
"it will be noticed that for something to be defamatory, injury to reputation is a basic ingredient. section 66a does not concern itself with injury to reputation. something may be grossly offensive
and may annoy or be inconvenient to somebody without at all affecting his reputation."
"something may be grossly offensive
and may annoy or be inconvenient to somebody without at all affecting his reputation. it is clear
therefore that the section is not aimed at defamatory statements at all. incitement to an offence:shreya singhal vs u.o.i on 24 march, T27
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110813550/ 2044."
"incitement to an offence:shreya singhal vs u.o.i on 24 march, T27
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110813550/ 2044. equally, section 66a has no proximate connection with incitement to commit an offence. firstly,
the information disseminated over the internet need not be information which ""incites"" anybody at
all."
"they may be ingredients of certain offences under the penal code but are not offences in
themselves. for these reasons, section 66a has nothing to do with ""incitement to an offence"". as
section 66a severely curtails information that may be sent on the internet based on whether it is
grossly offensive, annoying, inconvenient, etc."
"for these reasons, section 66a has nothing to do with ""incitement to an offence"". as
section 66a severely curtails information that may be sent on the internet based on whether it is
grossly offensive, annoying, inconvenient, etc. and being unrelated to any of the eight subject
matters under article 19(2) must, therefore, fall foul of article 19(1)(a), and not being saved under
article 19(2), is declared as unconstitutional."
"what has been said with regard to public order and incitement to an offence equally applies
here. section 66a cannot possibly be said to create an offence which falls within the expression
'decency' or 'morality' in that what may be grossly offensive or annoying under the section need not
be obscene at all - in fact the word 'obscene' is conspicuous by its absence in section 66a. 48."
"48. however, the learned additional solicitor general asked us to read into section 66a each of the
subject matters contained in article 19(2) in order to save the constitutionality of the provision. we
are afraid that such an exercise is not possible for the simple reason that when the legislature

"49. what the learned additional solicitor general is asking us to do is not to read down section 66a
- he is asking for a wholesale substitution of the provision which is obviously not possible. vagueness
50."
"vagueness
50. counsel for the petitioners argued that the language used in section 66a is so vague that neither
would an accused person be put on notice as to what exactly is the offence which has been
committed nor would the authorities administering the section be clear as to on which side of a
clearly drawn line a particular communication will fall. 51."
"51. we were given collin's dictionary, which defined most of the terms used in section 66a, as
follows:
""offensive:-
unpleasant or disgusting, as to the senses causing anger or annoyance; insulting for
the purpose of attack rather than defence. menace:-
to threaten with violence, danger, etc."
"52. the u.s. supreme court has repeatedly held in a series of judgments that where no reasonable
standards are laid down to define guilt in a section which creates an offence, and where no clear
guidance is given to either law abiding citizens or to authorities and courts, a section which creates
an offence and which is vague must be struck down as being arbitrary and unreasonable. thus, in
musser v. utah, 92 l. ed."
"1098, sacrilegious writings and utterances were outlawed. here
again, the u.s. supreme court stepped in to strike down the offending section stating:
""it is not a sufficient answer to say that 'sacrilegious' is definite, because all subjects
that in any way might be interpreted as offending the religious beliefs of any one of
the 300 sects of the united states are banned in new york. to allow such vague,
undefinable powers of censorship to be exercised is bound to have stultifying
consequences on the creative process of literature and art-for the films are derived
largely from literature."
"v. american civil liberties union et al., 521
u.s. 844 (1997), two provisions of the communications decency act of T25 which sought to protect
minors from harmful material on the internet were adjudged unconstitutional. this judgment is a
little important for two basic reasons - that it deals with a penal offence created for persons who use
the internet as also for the reason that the statute which was adjudged unconstitutional uses the
expression ""patently offensive"" which comes extremely close to the expression ""grossly offensive""
used by the impugned section 66a. section 223(d), which was adjudged unconstitutional, is set out
hereinbelow:-

interestingly, the district court judge writing of the internet said:
""[i]t is no exaggeration to conclude that the internet has achieved, and continues to
achieve, the most participatory marketplace of mass speech that this country - and
indeed the world - as yet seen."
"coming to this court's judgments, in state of madhya pradesh v. baldeo prasad, [1961] 1 s.c.r. 970 an inclusive definition of the word ""goonda"" was held to be vague and the offence created by
section 4a of the goondas act was, therefore, violative of article 19(1)(d) and (e) of the
constitution. it was stated:
""incidentally it would also be relevant to point out that the definition of the word
""goonda"" affords no assistance in deciding which citizen can be put under that
category."
"as we have already pointed out s. 4-a suffers from the
same infirmities as s. 4. having regard to the two infirmities in sections 4, 4-a respectively we do not think it
would be possible to accede to the argument of the learned advocate-general that
the operative portion of the act can fall under art. 19(5) of the constitution."
"in such a case it is absolutely
essential that the act must clearly indicate by a proper definition or otherwise when
and under what circumstances a person can be called a goonda, and it must impose
an obligation on the district magistrate to apply his mind to the question as to
whether the person against whom complaints are received is such a goonda or not. it
has been urged before us that such an obligation is implicit in sections 4 and 4-a. we
are, however, not impressed by this argument."
"a very pertinent example is to be found in
state of madhya pradesh and anr. v. baldeo prasad, 1961 (1) scr 970 where the
central provinces and berar goondas act 1946 was declared void for uncertainty.shreya singhal vs u.o.i on 24 march, T27
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110813550/ 30the condition for the application of sections 4 and 4a was that the person sought to
be proceeded against must be a goonda but the definition of goonda in the act
indicated no tests for deciding which person fell within the definition. the provisions
were therefore held to be uncertain and vague."
"similarly, in harakchand ratanchand banthia & ors. v. union of india & ors., T11 (2) scc 166,
section 27 of the gold control act was struck down on the ground that the conditions imposed by it
for the grant of renewal of licences are uncertain, vague and unintelligible. the court held:
""21."
"the court held:
""21. we now come to section 27 of the act which relates to licensing of dealers. it was
stated on behalf of the petitioners that the conditions imposed by sub-section (6) of
section 27 for the grant or renewal of licences are uncertain, vague and unintelligible
and consequently wide and unfettered power was conferred upon the statutory
authorities in the matter of grant or renewal of licence."
"we now come to section 27 of the act which relates to licensing of dealers. it was
stated on behalf of the petitioners that the conditions imposed by sub-section (6) of
section 27 for the grant or renewal of licences are uncertain, vague and unintelligible
and consequently wide and unfettered power was conferred upon the statutory
authorities in the matter of grant or renewal of licence. in our opinion this contention
is well founded and must be accepted as correct."
"in our opinion this contention
is well founded and must be accepted as correct. section 27(6)(a) states that in the
matter of issue or renewal of licences the administrator shall have regard to ""the
number of dealers existing in the region in which the applicant intends to carry on
business as a dealer"". but the word ""region""
is nowhere defined in the act."
"but the word ""region""
is nowhere defined in the act. similarly section 27(6)(b) requires the administrator to have regard
to ""the anticipated demand, as estimated by him, for ornaments in that region."" the expression
""anticipated demand"" is a vague expression which is not capable of objective assessment and is
bound to lead to a great deal of uncertainty."
"the expression
""anticipated demand"" is a vague expression which is not capable of objective assessment and is
bound to lead to a great deal of uncertainty. similarly the expression ""suitability of the applicant"" in
section 27(6)(e) and ""public interest"" in section 27(6)(g) do not provide any objective standard or
norm or guidance. for these reasons it must be held that clauses (a),(d),(e) and (g) of section 27(6)
impose unreasonable restrictions on the fundamental right of the petitioner to carry on business
and are constitutionally invalid."

norm or guidance. for these reasons it must be held that clauses (a),(d),(e) and (g) of section 27(6)
impose unreasonable restrictions on the fundamental right of the petitioner to carry on business
and are constitutionally invalid. it was also contended that there was no reason why the conditions
for renewal of licence should be as rigorous as the conditions for initial grant of licence."

requirement of strict conditions for the renewal of licence renders the entire future of the business

unreasonable. in our opinion clauses (a), (b), (e) and (g) are inextricably bound up with the other

restriction on the fundamental right of the petitioners to carry on business. it appears, however, to
us that if section 27(2)(d) and section 27(6) of the act are invalid the licensing scheme

the detaining authority can place under detention any person for possession of any
commodity on the basis that the authority is of the opinion that the maintenance of
supply of that commodity is essential to the community. we consider the particular
clause not only vague and uncertain but, in the context of the explanation, capable of
being extended cavalierly to supplies, the maintenance of which is not essential to the

an ingredient and the expression ""dishonestly"" and ""fraudulently"" are defined with some degree of
specificity, unlike the expressions used in section 66a. 71."
"71. the provisions contained in sections 66b up to section 67b also provide for various

in general."
"injury, danger or annoyance are not offences by themselves howsoever made and to
whomsoever made. the expression ""annoyance"" appears also in sections 294 and 510 of the ipc:

(b) sings, recites or utters any obscene songs, ballad or words, in or near any public
place, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which

emancipation of women or the abolition of the caste system or whether certain members of a non
proselytizing religion should be allowed to bring persons within their fold who are otherwise outside
the fold. each one of these things may be grossly offensive, annoying, inconvenient, insulting or
injurious to large sections of particular communities and would fall within the net cast by section

"this court in romesh thappar v. the state of
madras, [1950] s.c.r. 594 repelled a contention of severability when it came to the courts enforcing
the fundamental right under article 19(1)(a) in the following terms:
""it was, however, argued that section 9(1-a) could not be considered wholly void, as,
under article 13(1), an existing law inconsistent with a fundamental right is void only
to the extent of the inconsistency and no more. insofar as the securing of the public
safety or the maintenance of public order would include the security of the state, the
impugned provision, as applied to the latter purpose, was covered by clause (2) of
article 19 and must, it was said, be held to be valid."
"(at page 603)
95. it has been held by us that section 66a purports to authorize the imposition of restrictions on
the fundamental right contained in article 19(1)(a) in language wide enough to cover restrictions
both within and without the limits of constitutionally permissible legislative action. we have held
following k.a."
"we have held
following k.a. abbas' case (supra) that the possibility of section 66a being applied for purposes not
sanctioned by the constitution cannot be ruled out. it must, therefore, be held to be wholly
unconstitutional and void."

indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110813550/ 43""20. in romesh thappar v. state of madras [ (1950) scr 594] , the question was as to
the validity of section 9(1-a) of the madras maintenance of public order act, 23 of
T12 that section authorised the provincial government to prohibit the entry and
circulation within the state of a newspaper ""for the purpose of securing the public
safety or the maintenance of public order."""
"subsequent to the enactment of this
statute, the constitution came into force, and the validity of the impugned provision
depended on whether it was protected by article 19(2), which saved ""existing law
insofar as it relates to any matter which undermines the security of or tends to
overthrow the state."" it was held by this court that as the purposes mentioned in
section 9(1-a) of the madras act were wider in amplitude than those specified in
article 19(2), and as it was not possible to split up section 9(1-a) into what was
within and what was without the protection of article 19(2), the provision must fail in
its entirety. that is really a decision that the impugned provision was on its own
contents inseverable."
"in an article 19(1)(g) challenge, there is no question of a law being applied for
purposes not sanctioned by the constitution for the simple reason that the eight subject matters of
article 19(2) are conspicuous by their absence in article 19(6) which only speaks of reasonable
restrictions in the interests of the general public. the present is a case where, as has been held
above, section 66a does not fall within any of the subject matters contained in article 19(2) and the
possibility of its being applied for purposes outside those subject matters is clear. we therefore hold
that no part of section 66a is severable and the provision as a whole must be declared
unconstitutional."

unconstitutional. article 14
97."
"further, there is no intelligible differentia between
the medium of print, broadcast, and real live speech as opposed to speech on the internet and,
therefore, new categories of criminal offences cannot be made on this ground. similar offences
which are committed on the internet have a three year maximum sentence under section 66a as
opposed to defamation which has a two year maximum sentence. also, defamation is a
non-cognizable offence whereas under section 66a the offence is cognizable."

"98. we have already held that section 66a creates an offence which is vague and overbroad, and,

article 19(1)(a) nor can it justify its denial."

suffers from the vice of procedural unreasonableness. in that, if, for example, criminal defamation is
alleged, the safeguards available under section 199 cr.p.c."
"according to the petitioners, section 66a also
suffers from the vice of procedural unreasonableness. in that, if, for example, criminal defamation is
alleged, the safeguards available under section 199 cr.p.c. would not be available for a like offence
committed under section 66a."
"in that, if, for example, criminal defamation is
alleged, the safeguards available under section 199 cr.p.c. would not be available for a like offence
committed under section 66a. such safeguards are that no court shall take cognizance of such an
offence except upon a complaint made by some person aggrieved by the offence and that such
complaint will have to be made within six months from the date on which the offence is alleged to
have been committed."

"further, safeguards that are to be found in sections 95 and 96 of the cr.p.c. are also absent when it comes to section 66a. for example, where any newspaper book or document
wherever printed appears to contain matter which is obscene, hurts the religious feelings of some
community, is seditious in nature, causes enmity or hatred to a certain section of the public, or is
against national integration, such book, newspaper or document may be seized but under section 96

in high courts which consist of less than three judges, such special bench as may be composed of
all the judges of that high court."
"100. it is clear that sections 95 and 96 of the criminal procedure code reveal a certain degree of
sensitivity to the fundamental right to free speech and expression. if matter is to be seized on
specific grounds which are relatable to the subject matters contained in article 19(2), it would be
open for persons affected by such seizure to get a declaration from a high court consisting of at

this being a kerala act, it would fall outside entries1 and 2 of list ii and fall within entry 31 of list i. in order to appreciate the argument we set out the relevant entries:
""list - i
31."
"the kerala police act as a whole would necessarily fall under entry 2 of list ii. in addition, section
