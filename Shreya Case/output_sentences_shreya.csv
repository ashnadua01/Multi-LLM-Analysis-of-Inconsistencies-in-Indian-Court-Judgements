"The petitioners contend that the very basis of Section 66A - that it has given rise to new forms of
crimes - is incorrect, and that Sections 66B to 67C and various Sections of the Indian Penal Code
(which will be referred to hereinafter) are good enough to deal with all these crimes.",4.,5.

"In reply, Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Additional Solicitor General defended the constitutionality of
Section 66A.",6.,"He argued that the legislature is in the best position to understand and appreciate the
needs of the people."
"Loose language may have been used in Section 66A to deal with novel methods of
disturbing other people's rights by using the internet as a tool to do so.","Mere possibility of abuse of a provision cannot be a ground to declare a
provision invalid.","Further, vagueness is not a
ground to declare a statute unconstitutional if the statute is otherwise legislatively competent and

correct in saying that the public's right to know is directly affected by Section 66A.","In fact, it refers only to the medium
through which such information is disseminated.","Information of all
kinds is roped in - such information may have scientific, literary or artistic value, it may refer to
current events, it may be obscene or seditious."

inconvenience to some is how the offence is made out.","That the information sent has to be annoying, inconvenient, grossly offensive etc., also
shows that no distinction is made between mere discussion or advocacy of a particular point of view

words lead to an imminent causal connection with public disorder, security of State etc."
"The
petitioners are right in saying that Section 66A in creating an offence against persons who use the
internet and annoy or cause inconvenience to others very clearly affects the freedom of speech and
expression of the citizenry of India at large in that such speech or expression is directly curbed by
the creation of the offence contained in Section 66A.","That the information sent has to be annoying, inconvenient, grossly offensive etc., also

"While it may be possible to narrowly draw a Section creating a new offence,

"Because of its
absence, challenges made to an order made under Section 7 of the Punjab Maintenance of Public
Order Act and to an order made under Section 9 (1)(a) of the Madras Maintenance of Public Order
Act were allowed in two early judgments by this Court.",In Article 19(2) (as it originally stood) this sub-head was conspicuously absent.,"Thus in Romesh Thappar v. State of Madras,
[1950] S.C.R."
"594, this Court held that an order made under Section 9(1)(a) of the Madras
Maintenance of Public Order Act (XXIII of 1949) was unconstitutional and void in that it could not
be justified as a measure connected with security of the State.","Thus in Romesh Thappar v. State of Madras,
[1950] S.C.R.","While dealing with the expression
""public order"", this Court held that ""public order"" is an expression which signifies a state of
tranquility which prevails amongst the members of a political society as a result of the internal
regulations enforced by the Government which they have established."

Section 7 of the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, was held to be unconstitutional and void for the
self-same reason.","v. State of Delhi, [1950] S.C.R.",32.

implications are deeper and it affects the even tempo of life and public order is
jeopardized because the repercussions of the act embrace large Sections of the
community and incite them to make further breaches of the law and order and to
subvert the public order.",This is an act of a very different sort.,An act by itself is not determinant of its own gravity.
"Going by this
test, it is clear that Section 66A is intended to punish any person who uses the internet to
disseminate any information that falls within the sub-clauses of Section 66A.","We have to ask
ourselves the question: does a particular act lead to disturbance of the current life of the community

is not of any importance so far as this Section is concerned."

message.)"
"The Section makes no distinction between mass dissemination and

several individuals.","Further, the Section does not require that such message should have a
clear tendency to disrupt public order."
"Further, the Section does not require that such message should have a

dissemination to one person.","Such message need not have any potential which could
disturb the community at large."
"On all these counts, it is clear that the Section has no proximate
relationship to public order whatsoever.","The nexus between the message and action that may be taken based
on the message is conspicuously absent - there is no ingredient in this offence of inciting anybody to
do anything which a reasonable man would then say would have the tendency of being an immediate
threat to public safety or tranquility.","The example of a guest at a hotel `annoying' girls is telling -
this Court has held that mere `annoyance' need not cause disturbance of public order."

Section 66A, the offence is complete by sending a message for the purpose of causing annoyance,
either `persistently' or otherwise without in any manner impacting public order.","The example of a guest at a hotel `annoying' girls is telling -

"Again, in Dr. Ramesh Yeshwant
Prabhoo v. Prabhakar Kashinath Kunte & Ors., 1996 (1) SCC 130, Section 123 (3A) of the

"Viewed at either by the standpoint of the clear and present danger test or the tendency to create
public disorder, Section 66A would not pass muster as it has no element of any tendency to create
public disorder which ought to be an essential ingredient of the offence which it creates.",41.,"Defamation
42."
"Defamation is defined in Section 499 of the Penal Code as follows:
""499.","Defamation
42.","Defamation.-Whoever, by words either spoken or intended to be read, or by
signs or by visible representations, makes or publishes any imputation concerning
any person intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such
imputation will harm, the reputation of such person, is said, except in the cases
hereinafter excepted, to defame that person."
Section 66A does not concern itself with injury to reputation.,"It will be noticed that for something to be defamatory, injury to reputation is a basic ingredient.","Something may be grossly offensive
and may annoy or be inconvenient to somebody without at all affecting his reputation."
"It is clear
therefore that the Section is not aimed at defamatory statements at all.","Something may be grossly offensive

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110813550/ 2044.","Firstly,
the information disseminated over the internet need not be information which ""incites"" anybody at
all."
"For these reasons, Section 66A has nothing to do with ""incitement to an offence"".","They may be ingredients of certain offences under the Penal Code but are not offences in
themselves.","As
Section 66A severely curtails information that may be sent on the internet based on whether it is

matters under Article 19(2) must, therefore, fall foul of Article 19(1)(a), and not being saved under
Article 19(2), is declared as unconstitutional."
"Section 66A cannot possibly be said to create an offence which falls within the expression
'decency' or 'morality' in that what may be grossly offensive or annoying under the Section need not
be obscene at all - in fact the word 'obscene' is conspicuous by its absence in Section 66A.","What has been said with regard to public order and incitement to an offence equally applies
here.",48.

subject matters contained in Article 19(2) in order to save the constitutionality of the provision.",48.,"We

"Counsel for the petitioners argued that the language used in Section 66A is so vague that neither
would an accused person be put on notice as to what exactly is the offence which has been
committed nor would the authorities administering the Section be clear as to on which side of a
clearly drawn line a particular communication will fall.","Vagueness

"We were given Collin's dictionary, which defined most of the terms used in Section 66A, as
follows:
""Offensive:-
Unpleasant or disgusting, as to the senses Causing anger or annoyance; insulting For
the purpose of attack rather than defence.",51.,"Menace:-
To threaten with violence, danger, etc."
"The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly held in a series of judgments that where no reasonable
standards are laid down to define guilt in a Section which creates an offence, and where no clear
guidance is given to either law abiding citizens or to authorities and courts, a Section which creates
an offence and which is vague must be struck down as being arbitrary and unreasonable.",52.,"Thus, in
Musser v. Utah, 92 L. Ed."
"Here
again, the U.S. Supreme Court stepped in to strike down the offending Section stating:
""It is not a sufficient answer to say that 'sacrilegious' is definite, because all subjects
that in any way might be interpreted as offending the religious beliefs of any one of
the 300 sects of the United States are banned in New York.","1098, sacrilegious writings and utterances were outlawed.","To allow such vague,

the fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a) in the following terms:

purposes not sanctioned by the Constitution for the simple reason that the eight subject matters of

restrictions in the interests of the general public.","We therefore hold
