"(Civil) No. 171/96) O R D E R In view of the great significance of the points involved in
these matters, relating to the protection and conservation of the forests throughout the country, it
was considered necessary that the Central Government as well as the Governments of all the States
are heard. Accordingly, notice w as issued to all of them."
"We have heard the learned Attorney General and the other learned counsel on
these aspects. It has emerged at the hearing, that there is a misconception in certain quarters about the true scope
of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 (for short the `Act') and the meaning of the word ""forest"" used
therein. There is also a resulting misconception about the need of prior approval of the Central
Government, as required by Section 2 of the Act, in respect of certain activities in the forest area
which are more often of a commercial nature."

which are more often of a commercial nature. It is necessary to clarify that position."
"It is necessary to clarify that position. The Forest Conservation Act, 1980 was enacted with a view to check further deforestation which
ultimately results in ecological imbalance; and therefore, the provisions made therein for the
conservation of forests and fore matters connected therewith, must apply to all forests irrespective
of the nature of ownership or classification thereof. The word ""forest: must be understood according
to its dictionary meaning."

"The word ""forest: must be understood according
to its dictionary meaning. This description cover all statutorily recognised forests, whether
designated as reserved, protected or otherwise for the purpose of Section 2(i) of the Forest

understood in the dictionary sense, but also any area recorded as forest in the Government record
irrespective of the ownership."

Act."
"This is how it has to be understood for the purpose of Section 2 of the
Act. The provisions enacted in the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 for the conservation of forests and
the matters connected therewith must apply clearly to all forests so understood irrespective of the
ownership or classification thereof. This aspect has been made abundantly clear in the decisions of
this Court in Ambica Quarry Works and ors."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/298957/ 21. In view of the meaning of the word ""forest"" in the Act, it is obvious that prior
approval of the Central Government is required for any non-forest activity within the
area of any ""forest"". In accordance with Section 2 of the Act, all on-going activity
within any forest in any State throughout the country, without the prior approval of
the Central Government, must cease forthwith."
"In view of the meaning of the word ""forest"" in the Act, it is obvious that prior

area of any ""forest"". In accordance with Section 2 of the Act, all on-going activity
within any forest in any State throughout the country, without the prior approval of
the Central Government, must cease forthwith. It is, therefore, clear that the running
of saw mills of any kind including veneer or ply-wood mills, and mining of any
mineral are non-forest purposes and are, therefore, not permissible without prior
approval of the Central Government."
"In accordance with Section 2 of the Act, all on-going activity

of saw mills of any kind including veneer or ply-wood mills, and mining of any
mineral are non-forest purposes and are, therefore, not permissible without prior
approval of the Central Government. Accordingly, any such activity is prima facie
violation of the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980."
"2. In addition to the above, in the tropical wet ever-
green forests of Tirap and Changlang in the State of Arunachal Pradesh, there would be a complete
ban on felling of any kind of trees therein because of their particular significance to maintain
ecological balance needed to preserve bio-diversity. All saw mills, veneer mills and ply- wood mills

"3. The felling of trees in all forests is to remain suspended except in accordance with the Working
Plans of the State Governments, as approved by the Central Government. In the absence of any
Working Plan in any particular State, such as Arunachal Pradesh, where the permit system exists,
the felling under the permits can be done only by the Forest Department of the State Government or
the State Forest Corporation."

for defence or other Government purpose. This ban will also not affect felling in any private
plantation comprising of trees planted in any are which is not a forest. 5."
"5. Each State Government should constitute within one month an Expert Committee to:
