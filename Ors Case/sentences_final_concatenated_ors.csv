Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/338008/ 1certain scientific techniques, namely narcoanalysis, polygraph examination and the Brain Electrical
Activation Profile (BEAP) test for the purpose of improving investigation efforts in criminal cases. This issue has received considerable attention since it involves tensions between the desirability of
efficient investigation and the preservation of individual liberties."
"The involuntary administration of the impugned techniques prompts questions about the
protective scope of the `right against self-incrimination' which finds place in Article 20(3) of our
Constitution. In one of the impugned judgments, it has been held that the information extracted
through methods such as `polygraph examination' and the `Brain Electrical Activation Profile
(BEAP) test' cannot be equated with `testimonial compulsion' because the test subject is not
required to give verbal answers, thereby falling outside the protective scope of Article 20(3). It was
further ruled that the verbal revelations made during a narcoanalysis test do not attract the bar of
Article 20(3) since the inculpatory or exculpatory nature of these revelations is not known at the
time of conducting the test."
"DESCRIPTIONS OF TESTS - USES, LIMITATIONS AND
PRECEDENTS Polygraph Examination
9. The origins of polygraph examination have been traced back to the efforts of Lombroso, a
criminologist who experimented with a machine that measured blood pressure and pulse to assess
the honesty of persons suspected of criminal conduct. His device was called a hydrosphygmograph."
"A similar device was used by psychologist William Marston during World War I in espionage cases,
which proved to be a precursor to its use in the criminal justice system. In 1921, John Larson
incorporated the measurement of respiration rate and by 1939 Leonard Keeler added skin
conductance and an amplifier to the parameters examined by a polygraph machine. 10."
"10. The theory behind polygraph tests is that when a subject is lying in response to a question,
he/she will produce physiological responses that are different from those that arise in the normal
course. During the polygraph examination, several instruments are attached to the subject for
measuring and recording the physiological responses."
"The theory behind polygraph tests is that when a subject is lying in response to a question,
he/she will produce physiological responses that are different from those that arise in the normal
course. During the polygraph examination, several instruments are attached to the subject for
measuring and recording the physiological responses. The examiner then reads these results,
analyzes them and proceeds to gauge the credibility of the subject's answers."
"The examiner then reads these results,
analyzes them and proceeds to gauge the credibility of the subject's answers. Instruments such as
cardiographs, pneumographs, cardio-cuffs and sensitive electrodes are used in the course of
polygraph examinations. They measure changes in aspects such as respiration, blood pressure,
blood flow, pulse and galvanic skin resistance."

Manual - Polygraph Examination (Directorate of Forensic Science, Ministry of Home Affairs,
Government of India, New Delhi - 2005)]
11. There are three prominent polygraph examination techniques:
i. The relevant-irrelevant (R-I) technique ii."
"36 American Criminal Law Review 87-116 (Winter 1999) at
p. 91]. Needless to say, the polygraph examiner should be familiar with the details of
the ongoing investigation. To meet this end the investigators are required to share
copies of documents such as the First Information Report (FIR), Medico-Legal
Reports (MLR) and Post-Mortem Reports (PMR) depending on the nature of the
facts being investigated."
"13. The use of polygraph examinations in the criminal justice system has been contentious. In this
case, we are mainly considered with situations when investigators seek reliance on these tests to
detect deception or to verify the truth of previous testimonies."
"In this
case, we are mainly considered with situations when investigators seek reliance on these tests to
detect deception or to verify the truth of previous testimonies. Furthermore, litigation related to
polygraph tests has also involved situations where suspects and defendants in criminal cases have
sought reliance on them to demonstrate their innocence. It is also conceivable that witnesses can be
compelled to undergo polygraph tests in order to test the credibility of their testimonies or to
question their mental capacity or to even attack their character."

"14. Another controversial use of polygraph tests has been on victims of sexual offences for testing
the veracity of their allegations. While several states in the U.S.A. have enacted provisions to
prohibit such use, the text of the Laboratory Procedure Manual for Polygraph Examination [supra.]"
"indicates that this is an acceptable use. In this regard, Para 3.4 (v) of the said Manual reads as
follows:
""(v) In cases of alleged sex offences such as intercourse with a female child, forcible
rape, indecent liberties or perversion, it is important that the victim, as well as theSelvi & Ors vs State Of Karnataka & Anr on 5 May, 2010

Protection Act, 1998 was designed to restrict their use for employee screening."
"Instead, they could be triggered by nervousness, anxiety,
fear, confusion or other emotions. Furthermore, the physical conditions in the polygraph
examination room can also create distortions in the recorded responses. The test is best
administered in comfortable surroundings where there are no potential distractions for the subject
and complete privacy is maintained."
"17. The errors associated with polygraph tests are broadly grouped into two categories, i.e., `false
positives' and `false negatives'. A `false positive' occurs when the results indicate that a person has
been deceitful even though he/she answered truthfully."
"Conversely a `false negative' occurs when a
set of deceptive responses is reported as truthful. On account of such inherent complexities, the
qualifications and competence of the polygraph examiner are of the utmost importance. The
examiner needs to be thorough in preparing the questionnaire and must also have the expertise toSelvi & Ors vs State Of Karnataka & Anr on 5 May, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/338008/ 6account for extraneous conditions that could lead to erroneous inferences."
"18. However, the biggest concern about polygraph tests is that an examiner may not be able to
recognise deliberate attempts on part of the subject to manipulate the test results. Such
`countermeasures' are techniques which are deliberately used by the subject to create certain
physiological responses in order to deceive the examiner."
"19. Since polygraph tests have come to be widely relied upon for employee screening in the U.S.A.,
the U.S. Department of Energy had requested the National Research Council of the National
Academies (NRC) to review their use for different purposes. The following conclusion was stated in
its report, i.e."
"The Polygraph and Lie-Detection: Committee to Review the scientific evidence on the
Polygraph (Washington D.C.: National Academies Press, 2003) at pp. 212-213:

"A Working Party of the British Psychological Society (BPS) also came to a similar conclusion in a
study published in 2004. The key finding is reproduced below, [Cited from: A Review of the current
scientific status and fields of application of polygraph deception detection - Final Report (6 October,
2004) from The British Psychological Society (BPS) Working Party at p. 10]:
""A polygraph is sometimes called a lie detector, but this term is misleading. A
polygraph does not detect lies, but only arousal which is assumed to accompany
telling a lie."

"Polygraph examiners have no other option than to measure deception in
such an indirect way, as a pattern of physiological activity directly related to lying
does not exist (Saxe, 1991). Three of the four most popular lie detection procedures
using the polygraph (Relevant/Irrelevant Test, Control Question Test and Directed
Lie Test, ...) are built upon the premise that, while answering so-called `relevant'
questions, liars will be more aroused than while answering so-called `control'
questions, due to a fear of detection (fear of getting caught lying). This premise is
somewhat naive as truth tellers may also be more aroused when answering the
relevant questions, particularly: (i) when these relevant questions are emotion
evoking questions (e.g."
"This premise is
somewhat naive as truth tellers may also be more aroused when answering the
relevant questions, particularly: (i) when these relevant questions are emotion
evoking questions (e.g. when an innocent man, suspected of murdering his beloved
wife, is asked questions about his wife in a polygraph test, the memory of his late wife
might re-awaken his strong feelings about her); and (ii) when the innocent examinee
experiences fear, which may occur, for example, when the person is afraid that his or
her honest answers will not be believed by the polygraph examiner. The other
popular test (Guilty Knowledge Test, ...) is built upon the premise that guilty
examinees will be more aroused concerning certain information due to different
orienting reactions, that is, they will show enhanced orienting responses when
recognising crucial details of a crime."
"21. Coming to judicial precedents, a decision reported as Frye v. United States, (1923) 54 App DC 46,
dealt with a precursor to the polygraph which detected deception by measuring changes in systolic
blood pressure. In that case the defendant was subjected to this test before the trial and his counsel
had requested the court that the scientist who had conducted the same should be allowed to give
expert testimony about the results."
"Prior to the Daubert decision (supra. ), most jurisdictions in the U.S.A. had disapproved of the
use of polygraph tests in criminal cases. Some State jurisdictions had absolutely prohibited the
admission of polygraph test results, while a few had allowed consideration of the same if certain
conditions were met."

"These conditions included a prior stipulation between the parties to undergo
these tests with procedural safeguards such as the involvement of experienced examiners, presence
of counsel and proper recording to enable subsequent scrutiny. A dissonance had also emerged in
the treatment of polygraph test results in the different Circuit jurisdictions, with some jurisdictions
giving trial judges the discretion to enquire into the reliability of polygraph test results on a
case-by-case basis. 26."
"For example, in United States v. Piccinonna, 885 F.2d 1529 (11th Circ. 1989), it was noted that in
some instances polygraphy satisfied the standard of `general acceptance in the particular field' as
required by Frye (supra.). It was held that polygraph testimony could be admissible under two
situations, namely when the parties themselves agree on a stipulation to this effect or for the
purpose of impeaching and corroborating the testimony of witnesses."

instrumentation and technique in the years since Frye. The test at issue in Frye

questions."

unanimously attributed to variations in the integrity of the testing environment and
the qualifications of the examiner."

disciplines and for much of the scientific evidence we routinely find admissible under

evidence'. The discussion also concluded that polygraph evidence is inadmissible as `expert
evidence'. 38."

""... In my view, the rule against admission of consistent out-of-court statements is
soundly based and particularly apposite to questions raised in connection with the
use of the polygraph. Polygraph evidence when tendered would be entirely
self-serving and would shed no light on the real issues before the court."

A defendant who attempts to put in the results of a test showing this truthfulness on
the matters in issue is bound to fall foul of the rule against self- serving statements or,
as it is sometimes called, the rule that a party cannot manufacture evidence for
himself, and the falling foul will not be in any mere technical sense. The rule is
sometimes applied in a mechanical unintelligent way to exclude evidence about
which no realistic objection could be raised, as the leading case, Gillie v. Posho
shows; but striking down defence polygraph evidence on this ground would be no
mere technical reflex action of legal obscurantists. The policy behind the doctrine is a
fundamental one, and defence polygraph evidence usually offends it fundamentally."

designed to keep the focus of the proceedings on the principal issue, in a criminal

intervention of the operator."
"To begin with, it must be
remembered that however scientific it may be, its use in court depends on the human
intervention of the operator. Whatever results are recorded by the polygraph
instrument, their nature and significance reach the trier of fact through the mouth of
the operator. Human fallibility is therefore present as before, but now it may be said
to be fortified with the mystique of science."
"62. Notably, the appellant had refused to undergo a narcoanalysis interview or a polygraph test. It
was also evident that he had not consented to the hypnosis."
"The test needs to be conducted in an insulated
and air-conditioned room in order to prevent distortions arising out of weather conditions. Much
like the narcoanalysis technique and polygraph examination, this test also requires effective
collaboration between the investigators and the examiner, most importantly for designing the
stimuli which are called `probes'. Ascertaining the subject's familiarity with the `probes' can help in
detecting deception or to gather useful information."
"As per the Laboratory Procedure manuals, the impugned tests are being conducted at the
direction of jurisdictional courts even without obtaining the consent of the intended test subjects. In
most cases these tests are conducted conjunctively wherein the veracity of the information revealed
through narcoanalysis is subsequently tested through a polygraph examination or the BEAP test. In
some cases the investigators could first want to ascertain the capacity of the subject to deceive
(through polygraph examination) or his/her familiarity with the relevant facts (through BEAP test)
before conducting a narcoanalysis interview."

some cases the investigators could first want to ascertain the capacity of the subject to deceive

are administered, we have to decide on their permissibility in circumstances where any of these tests
are compulsorily administered, either independently or conjunctively."
"131. However, an unresolved question is whether the results obtained through polygraph
examination and the BEAP test are of a testimonial nature. In both these tests, inferences are drawn
from the physiological responses of the subject and no direct reliance is placed on verbal responses."
"In both these tests, inferences are drawn
from the physiological responses of the subject and no direct reliance is placed on verbal responses. In some forms of polygraph examination, the subject may be required to offer verbal answers such
as `Yes' or `No', but the results are based on the measurement of changes in several physiological
characteristics rather than these verbal responses. In the BEAP test, the subject is not required to
give any verbal responses at all and inferences are drawn from the measurement of electrical activity
in the brain."
"It has been contended that the phrase `modern and
scientific techniques including DNA profiling and such other tests' should be liberally construed to
include the impugned techniques. It was argued that even though the narcoanalysis technique,
polygraph examination and the BEAP test have not been expressly enumerated, they could be read
in by examining the legislative intent. Emphasis was placed on the phrase `and such other tests' to
argue that the Parliament had chosen an approach where the list of `modern and scientific
techniques' contemplated was illustrative and not exhaustive."
"Hence, on an aggregate understanding of the materials produced before us we lean towards the view
that the impugned tests, i.e. the narcoanalysis technique, polygraph examination and the BEAP test
should not be read into the provisions for `medical examination' under the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973.Selvi & Ors vs State Of Karnataka & Anr on 5 May, 2010

expressly enumerated in the CrPC, there is no statutory prohibition against them either."
"Results of impugned tests should be treated as
`personal testimony'
157. We now return to the operative question of whether the results obtained through polygraph
examination and the BEAP test should be treated as testimonial responses. Ordinarily evidence is
classified into three broad categories, namely oral testimony, documents and material evidence."
"The difficulty arises since the majority opinion in
that case appears to confine the understanding of `personal testimony' to the conveyance of
personal knowledge through oral statements or statements in writing. The results obtained from
polygraph examination or a BEAP test are not in the nature of oral or written statements. Instead,
inferences are drawn from the measurement of physiological responses recorded during the
performance of these tests."
"Instead,
inferences are drawn from the measurement of physiological responses recorded during the
performance of these tests. It could also be argued that tests such as polygraph examination and the
BEAP test do not involve a `positive volitional act' on part of the test subject and hence their results
should not be treated as testimony. However, this does not entail that the results of these two testsSelvi & Ors vs State Of Karnataka & Anr on 5 May, 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/338008/ 69should be likened to physical evidence and thereby excluded from the protective scope of Article
20(3)."
"At that time, the transmission of knowledge
through means other than speech or writing was not something that could have been easily
conceived of. Techniques such as polygraph examination were fairly obscure and were the subject of
experimentation in some Western nations while the BEAP technique was developed several years
later. Just as the interpretation of statutes has to be often re-examined in light of scientific
advancements, we should also be willing to re- examine judicial observations with a progressive
lens."
"160. Even though the actual process of undergoing a polygraph examination or a BEAP test is not
the same as that of making an oral or written statement, the consequences are similar. By making
inferences from the results of these tests, the examiner is able to derive knowledge from the subject's
mind which otherwise would not have become available to the investigators."
"161. During the administration of a polygraph test or a BEAP test, the subject makes a mental effort
which is accompanied by certain physiological responses. The measurement of these responses then
becomes the basis of the transmission of knowledge to the investigators."
"162. Some academics have also argued that the results obtained from tests such as polygraph
examination are `testimonial' acts that should come within the prohibition of the right against
self-incrimination. For instance, Michael S. Pardo (2008) has observed [Cited from: Michael S.
Pardo, `Self- Incrimination and the Epistemology of Testimony', 30 Cardozo Law Review 1023-1046
(December 2008) at p. 1046]:

voluntary response or not, are testimonial because the tests are just inductive
evidence of the defendant's epistemic state."

"Hence, our conclusion is
that the results obtained through the involuntary administration of either of the impugned tests (i.e. the narcoanalysis technique, polygraph examination and the BEAP test) come within the scope of
`testimonial compulsion', thereby attracting the protective shield of Article 20(3). II."
"In response, the counsel for the respondents have drawn our attention to literature which
suggests that in the case of the impugned techniques, the intention on part of the investigators is to
extract information and not to inflict any pain or suffering. Furthermore, it has been contended that
the actual administration of either the narcoanalysis technique, polygraph examination or the BEAP
test does not involve a condemnable degree of `physical pain or suffering'. Even though some
physical force may be used or threats may be given to compel a person to undergo the tests, it was
argued that the administration of these tests ordinarily does not result in physical injuries."
"When a person undergoes a narcoanalysis test, he/she is in a
half- conscious state and subsequently does not remember the revelations made in a drug-induced
state. In the case of polygraph examination and the BEAP test, the test subject remains fully
conscious during the tests but does not immediately know the nature and implications of the results
derived from the same. However, when he/she later learns about the contents of the revelations,
they may prove to be incriminatory or be in the nature of testimony that can be used to prosecute
other individuals."
"In case of the narcoanalysis technique, the subject speaks in a
drug-induced state and is clearly not aware of his/her own responses at the time. In the context of
polygraph examination and the BEAP tests, the subject cannot anticipate the contents of the
`relevant questions' that will be asked or the `probes' that will be shown. Furthermore, the results
are derived from the measurement of physiological responses and hence the subject cannot exercise
an effective choice between remaining silent and imparting personal knowledge."
"Furthermore, empirical studies have shown that during the hypnotic stage, individuals are prone to
suggestibility and there is a good chance that false results could lead to a finding of guilt or
innocence. As far as polygraph examination is concerned, though there are some studies showing
improvements in the accuracy of results with advancement in technology, there is always scope for
error on account of several factors. Objections can be raised about the qualifications of the
examiner, the physical conditions under which the test was conducted, the manner in which
questions were framed and the possible use of `countermeasures' by the test subject."
"Objections can be raised about the qualifications of the
examiner, the physical conditions under which the test was conducted, the manner in which
questions were framed and the possible use of `countermeasures' by the test subject. A significant
criticism of polygraphy is that sometimes the physiological responses triggered by feelings such as
anxiety and fear could be misread as those triggered by deception. Similarly, with the P300 Waves
test there are inherent limitations such as the subject having had `prior exposure' to the `probes'
which are used as stimuli."
"Sometimes the revelations may
begin to make sense only when compared with the testimony of several other individuals or through
the discovery of fresh materials. In a polygraph test, interpreting the results is a complex process
that involves accounting for distortions such as `countermeasures' used by the subject and weather
conditions among others. In a BEAP test, there is always the possibility of the subject having had
prior exposure to the `probes' that are used as stimuli."
