"The  other Judge basedK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 2his conclusion  on the  ground that  no reasonable
body of  persons could come to the conclusion that
jury had  arrived at. On appeal  to this Court by
special leave  it was  contended on  behalf of the
appellant  that  under  s.  307   of  the  Code  of
Criminal Procedure  it was  incumbent on  the High
Court to decide the competency of the reference on
a perusal  of the  order of reference itself since
it had no jurisdiction to go into the evidence for
that  purpose,   that  the   High  Court  was  not
empowered by  s. 307(3)  of the  Code to set aside
the verdict  of the  jury on the ground that there
were misdirections  in the charge, that there were
no misdirections in the charge nor was the verdict
perverse and that since there was grave and sudden
provocation the  offence committed if any, was not
murder but  culpable  homicide  not  amounting  to
murder."
"There is nothing in s. 307(1)
of the  Code that  lends support to the contention
that  though  the  Judge  had  complied  with  the
necessary conditions, the High Court should reject
the reference  without going  into the evidence ifK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 3the reasons  given in  the order  of reference did
not sustain the view expressed by the Judge. Section 307(3)  of the Code by empowering the
High Court either to acquit or convict the accused
after considering  the entire evidence, giving due
weight to  the opinions  of the Sessions Judge and
the jury,  virtually conferred  the functions both
of the jury and the Judge on it."
"Even if the accused fails

"November 24. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUBBA RAO, J.-This appeal by
special leave arises out of the judgment of the Bombay High Court sentencing Nanavati, the
appellant, to life imprisonment for the murder of Prem Bhagwandas Ahuja, a businessman of
Bombay. This appeal presents the commonplace problem of an alleged murder by an enraged husband of a
paramour of his wife: but it aroused considerable interest in the public mind by reason of the
publicity it received and the important constitutional point it had given rise to at the time of its
admission."
"The said reference was heard by a division bench of the saidK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 7High Court consisting of Shelat and Naik, JJ. The two learned Judges gave separate judgments, but
agreed in holding that the accused was guilty of the offence of murder under s. 302 of the Indian
Penal Code and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life."
"They have three children by the marriage, a boy aged 9 1/2 years a
girl aged 5 1/2 years and another boy aged 3 years. Since the time of marriage, the couple were living
at different places having regard to the exigencies of service of Nanavati. Finally, they shifted to
Bombay."
"In the same city the deceased Ahuja was doing business in automobiles and was residing,
along with his sister, in a building called ""Shreyas"" till 1957 and thereafter in another building called
""Jivan Jyot"" in Setalvad Road. In the year 1956, Agniks, who were common friends of Nanavatis and
Ahujas, introduced Ahuja and his sister to Nanavatis. Ahuja was unmarried and was about 34 years
of age at the time of his death, Nanavati, as a Naval Officer, was frequently going away from Bombay
in his ship, leaving his wife and children in Bombay."

of age at the time of his death, Nanavati, as a Naval Officer, was frequently going away from Bombay

and Sylvia, which culminated in illicit intimacy between them."
"Gradually, friendship developed between Ahuja
and Sylvia, which culminated in illicit intimacy between them. On April 27, 1959, Sylvia confessed to
Nanavati of her illicit intimacy with Ahuja. Enraged at the conduct of Ahuja, Nanavati went to his
ship, took from the stores of the ship a semi- automatic revolver and six cartridges on a false pretext,
loaded the same, went to the flat of Ahuja entered his bed-room and shot him dead."

"Thereafter, he drove his wife, two of his children and a neighbour's child in his car to a cinema,K. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 8dropped them there and promised to come and pick them up at 6 P.M. when the show ended. He
then drove his car to his ship, as he wanted to get medicine for his sick dog, he represented to the
authorities in the ship, that he wanted to draw a revolver and six rounds from the stores of the ship
as he was going to drive alone to Ahmednagar by night, though the real purpose was to shoot
himself."
"If the High Court holds
that the verdict of the jury is not unreasonable, in the case of a verdict of ""not guilty"", the High CourtK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 9acquits the accused, and in the case where the verdict is one of ""guilty"" it convicts the accused. In
case the High Court holds that the verdict of ""not guilty"", is unreasonable, it refers back the case to
the Sessions Judge, who convicts the accused; thereafter the accused will have a right of appeal
wherein he can attack the validity of his conviction on the ground that there were misdirections in
the charge of the jury."
"But s. 418 of the Code provides:
""(1) An appeal may lie on a matter of fact as well as a matter of law except where the
trial was by jury, in which case the appeal shall lie on a matter of law only.""K. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 10Sub-section (2) therefore provides for a case of a person sentenced to death, with which we are not
now concerned. Section 423 confers certain powers on an appellate Court in the matter of disposing
of an appeal, such as calling for the record, hearing of the pleaders, and passing appropriate orders
therein."
"But in 1882 the section was amended and under the amended
section the condition for reference was that the High Court should differ from the jury completely;
but in the Code of 1893 the section was amended practically in terms as it now appears in the Code.K. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 11The history of the legislation shows that the section was intended as a safeguard against erroneous
verdicts of inexperienced furors and also indicates the clear intention of the Legislature to confer on
a High Court a separate jurisdiction, which for convenience may be described as ""reference
jurisdiction"". Section 307 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, while continuing the benefits of the
jury system to persons tried by a Court of Session, also guards against any possible injustice, having
regard to the conditions obtaining in India."
"In that case the Judicial Committee relied upon the words ""ends of
justice"" end held that the verdict was one which no reasonable body of men could have, reached on
the evidence and further laid down that the requirements of the ends of justice must be the
determining factor both for the Sessions Judge in making the reference and for the High Court in
disposing of it. The Judicial Committee observed:K. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 12""In general, if the evidence is such that it can properly support a verdict either of
guilty or not guilty, according to the view taken of it by the trial court, and if the jury
take one view of the evidence and the judge thinks that they should have taken the
other, the view of the jury. must prevail, since they are the judges of fact."
"It also defined the scope of its jurisdiction and its limitations The High Court canK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 13acquit or convict an accused of an offence of which the jury could have convicted him, and also pass
such sentence as might have been passed by the Court of Session. But before doing so, it shall
consider the entire evidence and give due weight to the opinions of the Sessions Judge and the jury."
"This argument is built upon the hypothesis that under the
Code of criminal Procedure there is a clear demarcation of the functions of the jury and the Judge,
the jury dealing with facts and the Judge with the and therefore the High Court could set aside a
verdict on the ground of misdirection only when an appeal comes to it under s. 418 and could only
interfere with the verdict of the jury for the ends of justice, as interpreted by the Privy Council, whenK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 14the matter comes to it under 8. 307 (3)."
"The decisions cited at the Bar do not in any way sustain in narrow construction sought to be placed
by learned counsel on s. 307 of the code. In Ramanugrah Singh's case (1), which have been referred
to earlier, the Judicial Committee described the wide amplitude of the power of the High Court in
the following terms:K. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 15""The Court must consider the whole case and give due weight to the opinions of the
Sessions Judge and jury, and than acquit or convict the accused."" The Judicial Committee took care to observe:
"".... the test of reasonableness on the part of the jury may not be conclusive in every
case."
"But the Sessions Judge
recorded his judgment of acquittal in respect of the latter charges in agreement with the jury andK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 16referred the case to the High Court only in respect of the former. This Court held that the said
procedure violated sub-s. (2) of s. 307 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and also had the effect of
preventing the High Court from considering the entire evidence against the accused and exercising
its jurisdiction under sub-s. (3) of s. 307 of the said Code."
"(6) In the disposal of the said reference, the High Court canK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 17exercise any of the procedural powers appropriate to the occasion, such as, issuing of
notice, calling for records, remanding the case, ordering a retrial, etc. We therefore,
reject the first contention of learned counsel for the appellant."
"Evidence Act.K. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 18Section 103: ""The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that person who wishes the Court
to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any
particular person."" Section 105: ""When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of
circumstances bringing the case within any of the General Exceptions in the Indian Penal Code
(XLV of 1860) or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same
Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of
such circumstances."""
"This
presumption may also be rebutted by admissions made or circumstances elicited by
the evidence led by the prosecution or by the combined effect of such circumstancesK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 19and the evidence adduced by the accused. But the section does not in any way affect
the burden that lies on the prosecution to prove all the ingredients of the offence with
which the accused is charged: that burden never shifts."
"The failure on the part of the
accused to establish all the circumstances bringing his case under the exception does not absolve the
prosecution to prove the ingredients of the offence; indeed, the evidence, though insufficient to
establish the exception, may be sufficient to negative one or more of the ingredients of the offence.K. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 20The English decisions relied upon by Mr. Pathak, learned counsel for the accused, may not be of
much help in construing the provisions of s. 105 of the Indian Evidence Act. We would, therefore,
prefer not to refer to them, except to one of the leading decisions on the subject, namely,
Woolmington v. The Director of Public Prosecutions."
"In that case, two persons
were prosecuted, one for performing an illegal operation and the other for abetting him in thatK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 21crime. Under s. 106 of the Ordinance 14 of 1895 in the Ceylon Code, which corresponds to s. 106 of
the Indian Evidence Act, it was enacted that when any fact was especially within the knowledge of
any person, the burden of proving that fact was upon him."
"In
paragraph 6 of the charge, the learned Sessions Judge stated:
""Before I proceed further I have to point out another section which is sectionK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 2280. You know by now that the defence of the accused is that the firing of the revolver
was a matter of accident during a struggle for possession of the revolver."
"In such circumstances, we cannot predicate that the jury
understood the legal implications of s. 80 of the Indian Penal Code and the scope of the burden ofK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 23proof under s. 105 of the Evidence Act, and gave their verdict correctly. Nor can we say that the jury
understood the distinction between the ingredients of the offence and the circumstances that attract
s. 80 of the Indian Penal Code and the impact of the proof of some of the said circumstances on the
proof of the ingredients of the offence."
"If, on the other hand, the case is
one in which the view might fairly be taken (a) that a reasonable person, in
consequence of the provocation received, might be so rendered subject to passion or
loss of control as to be led to use the violence with fatal results, and (b) that the
accused was in fact acting under the stress of such provocation, then it is for the jury
to determine whether on its view of the facts manslaughter or murder is the
appropriate verdict."" Viscount Simon brought out the distinction between the respective duties of the judge and the jury
succinctly by formulating the following questions:K. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 24""The distinction, therefore, is between asking 'Could the evidence support the view
that the provocation was sufficient to lead a reasonable person to do what the
accused did ?' (which is for the judge to rule), and, assuming that the judge's ruling is
in affirmative, asking the jury: 'Do you consider that, on the facts as you find them
from the evidence, the provocation was in fact enough to lead a reasonable person to
do what the accused did ?'"
"These facts
must lead to one conclusion and one only namely the guilt of the accused and lastly it
must exclude all reasonable hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the accused,K. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 25all reasonable hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the accused should be
excluded. In other words you must come to the conclusion by all the human
probability, it must be the accused and the accused only who must have committed
this crime."
"Finally the learned Sessions Judge told them:
""If on the other hand you think that the circumstances on which the prosecution
relies are fully and firmly established, that they lead to one and the only conclusion
and one only, of the guilt of the accused and that they exclude all reasonable
hypothesis of the innocence of the accused then and in that case it will be your duty
which you are bound by the oath to bring verdict accordingly without any fear or any
favour and without regard being had to any consequence that this verdict might lead
to.""K. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 26Mr. Pathak contends that the learned Sessions Judge dealt with the evidence in two parts, in one
part he explained to the jury the well settled rule of approach to circumstantial evidence, whereas in
another part he clearly and definitely pointed to the jury the great evidentially value of the
extra-judicial confession of guilt by the accused made to Puransingh, if that was believed by them."
"In these circumstances
we must hold, agreeing with the High Court, that this is a grave misdirection affecting the
correctness of the verdict. The next misdirection relied upon by the High Court is the circumstance that the three letters
written by Sylvia were not read to the jury by the learned Sessions Judge in his charge and that the
jury were not told of their effect on the credibility of the evidence of Sylvia and Nanavati. Shelat, J.,
observed in regard to this circumstance thus:
""It cannot be gainsaid that these letters were important documents disclosing the
state of mind of Mrs. Nanavati and the deceased to a certain extent."

had been read in juxtaposition of Mrs. Nanavati's evidence they would have shown
that her statement that she felt that Ahuja had asked her not to see him for a month
for the purpose of backing out of the intended marriage was not correct and that they
had agreed not to see each other for the purpose of giving her and also to him an
opportunity to coolly think out the implications of such a marriage and then to make
up her own mind on her own."

asked her, as he said in his evidence, whether Ahuja would marry her, it was not
probable that she would fence that question."
"Mr. Pathak contends that these letters were read to the jury by counsel on both sides and a reference
was also made to hem in the evidence of Sylivia and, therefore the jury clearly knew the contents ofK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 27the letters, and that in the circumstances the non-mention of the contents of the letters by the
Sessions Judge was not a misdirection and even if it was it did not affect the verdict of the jury. In
this context reliance is placed upon two English decisions, namely, R. v. Roberts (1) and R. v.
Attfield (2)."
"Whether a particular
omission by a judge to place before the jury certain evidence amounts to a misdirection or not falls
to be decided on the facts of cash case. These letters show the exact position of Sylvia in the context of her intended marriage with Ahuja,
and help to test the truthfulness or otherwise of some of the assertions made by her to Nanavati. A
perusal of these letters indicates that Sylvia and Ahuja were on intimate terms, that Ahuja wasK."

way and even to help them to marry, their evidence that Sylvia did not answer the direct question
about the intentions of Ahuja to marry her, and the evidence of Nanavati that it became necessary

documents are filed, it is difficult for a lay jury, unless properly directed, to realise the relative
importance of specified documents in the context of different aspects of a case."
"But latter on between 10 and 10-30 P. M. on the same day,K. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 29Phansalkar made a statement to Inspector Mokashi what Puransingh had told him and that
statement was recorded by Mokashi. In the statement taken by Mokashi it was not recorded that
Puransingh told Phansalkar that the accused told him why he had killed Ahuja."
"In the statement taken by Mokashi it was not recorded that
Puransingh told Phansalkar that the accused told him why he had killed Ahuja. When Phansalkar
was in the witness-box to a question put to him in cross-examination he answered that Puransingh
did not tell him that he had asked Nanavati why he killed Ahuja and that the accused replied that he
had a quarrel with the deceased as the latter had ""connections"" with his wife and that he had killed
him. The learned Sessions Judge not only allowed the evidence to go in but also, in paragraph 18 of
his charge to the jury, referred to that statement."
"After giving the summary of the evidence given by
Puransingh, the learned Sessions Judge proceeded to state in his charge to the jury:
""Now the conversation between him and Phansalkar (Sub-Inspector) was brought on
record in which what the chowkidar told Sub- Inspector Phansalkar was, the servants
of the flat of Miss Ahuja had informed him that a Naval Officer was going away in the
car. He and the servants had tried to stop him but the said officer drove away in the
car saying that he was going to the Police Station and to Sub-Inspector Phansalkar he
did not state about the admission made by Mr. Nanavati to him that he killed the
deceased as the deceased had connections with his wife. The chowkidar said that he
had told this also to sub-Inspector Phansalkar."
"Learned counsel for the
accused, on the other hand, contends that the alleged statement was made to a police officer before
the investigation commenced and, therefore, it was not hit by s. 162 of the Code of CriminalK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 30Procedure, and it could be used to contradict the evidence of Puransingh. Section 162 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure reads:
""(1) No statement made by any person to a Police officer in the course of an
investigation under this Chapter shall, if reduced into writing be signed by the person
making it; nor shall any such statement or any record thereof, whether in a police
diary or otherwise, or any part of such statement or record, be used for any purpose,
save as hereinafter provided, at any inquiry or trial in respect of any offence under
investigation at the time when such statement was made:
""Provided that when any witness is called for the prosecution in such inquiry or trial
whose statement has been reduced into writing as aforesaid, any part of his
statement, if duly proved, may be used by the accused, and with the permission of the
Court, by the prosecution, to contradict such witness in the manner provided by
section 145 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872), and when any part of such
statement is so used, any part thereof may also be used in the re-examination of such
witness, but for the purpose only of explaining any matter referred to in his
cross-examination."""
"Under s. 162(1) of the Code, noK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961

statement made. But the proviso lifts the ban and says that when any witness is called for the
prosecution in such inquiry or trial whose statement has been reduced into writing, any part of his
statement, if duly proved, may be used by the accused to contradict such witness."
"But, as we have heard
counsel at great length, we propose to discuss the evidence.K. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 32We shall now proceed to consider the evidence in the case. The evidence can be divided into three
parts, namely, (i) evidence relating to the conduct of the accused before the shooting incident, (ii)
evidence in regard to the conduct of the accused after the incident, and (iii) evidence in regard to the
actual shooting in the bed-room of Ahuja."
"It appears to us that this is clearly a made-up
conversation and an unnatural one too. Is it likely that Nanavati, who says in his evidence that prior
to April 27, 1959, he did not think that his wife was unfaithful to him, would have suddenly thought
that she had a lover on the basis of a trivial circumstance of her being unresponsive when he put his
arm around her affectionately ? Her coldness towards him might have been due to many reasons."
"Her coldness towards him might have been due to many reasons. Unless he had a suspicion earlier or was informed by somebody that she was unfaithful to him, this
conduct of Nanavati in suspecting his wife on the basis of the said circumstance does not appear to
be the natural reaction of a husband. The recollection of her preference to attend the dinner given by
Miss Mammie to that of his brother, in the absence of an earlier suspicion or information, could not
have flashed on his mind the image of Ahuja as a possible lover of his wife."
"If the confession of illicit
intimacy between Sylvia and Ahuja was made so suddenly at lunch time, even if she had purchased
the tickets, it is not likely that he would have taken her and the children to the cinema. Nanavati
then proceeds to say in his evidence : on his wife admitting her illicit intimacy with Ahuja, he was
absolutely stunned; he then got up and said that he must go and settle the matter with the swine; he
asked her what were the intentions of Ahuja and whether Ahuja was prepared to marry her and look
after the children; he wanted an explanation from Ahuja for his caddish conduct. In the
cross-examination he further elaborated on his intentions thus : He thought of having the matters
settled with Ahuja; he would find out from him whether he would take an honourable way out of theK."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 33situation; and he would thrash him if he refused to do so. The honourable course which he expected
of the deceased was to marry his wife and look after the children."
"He made it clear further that when
he went to see Ahuja the main thing in his mind was to find out what Ahuja's intentions were
towards his wife and children and to find out the explanation for his conduct. Sylvia in her evidence
says that when she confessed her unfaithfulness to Nanavati the latter suddenly got up rather
excitedly and said that he wanted to go to Ahuja's flat and square up the things. Briefly stated,
Nanavati, according to him, went to Ahuja's flat to ask for an explanation for seducing his wife and
to find out whether he would marry Sylvia and take care of the children."
"Sylvia in her evidence

Nanavati, according to him, went to Ahuja's flat to ask for an explanation for seducing his wife and
to find out whether he would marry Sylvia and take care of the children. Is it likely that a person,
situated as anavati was, would have reacted in the manner stated by him?"
"But it is most improbable, even impossible, that a husband who has been deceived by his
wife would voluntarily go to the house of his wife's paramour to ascertain his intentions, and, what
is more, to ask him to take charge of his children. What was the explanation Nanavati wanted to get
from Ahuja ? His wife confessed that she had illicit intimacy with Ahuja."
"There was no question of Ahuja seducing an innocent girl, but both
Ahuja and Sylvia must have been willing parties to the illicit intimacy between them. That apart, it is
clear from the evidence that Ahuja and Sylvia had decided to marry and, therefore, no further
elucidation of the intention of Ahuja by Nanavati was necessary at all. It is true that Nanavati says in
his evidence that when he asked her whether Ahuja was prepared to marry her and look after the
children, she did not give any proper reply; and Sylvia also in her evidence says that when her
husband asked her whether Ahuja was willing to marry her and look after the children she avoided
answering that question as she was too ashamed to admit that Ahuja was trying to back out from the
promise to marry her."

answering that question as she was too ashamed to admit that Ahuja was trying to back out from the
promise to marry her. That this version is not true is amply borne out by the letters written by Sylvia
to Ahuja."
"I am torturingK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 34myself in every possible way as you asked, so that, there will be no surprise afterwards"". This letter clearly demonstrates that she agreed not to see Ahuja for a month, not because that
Ahuja refused to marry her, but because it was settled that they should marry, and that in view of
the far-reaching effects of the separation from her husband on her future life and that of her
children, the lovers wanted to live separately to judge for themselves whether they really loved each
other so much as to marry."
"We have no doubt that her
evidence, not only in regard to the question of marriage but also in regard to other matters, indicates
that having lost her lover, out of necessity or out of deep penitence for her past misbehavior, she is
out to help he husband in his defence. This correspondence belies the entire story that Sylvia did not
reply to Nanavati when the latter asked her whether Ahuja was willing to marry her and that was the
reason why Nanavati wanted to visit Ahuja to ask him about him intentions. We cannot visualize
Nanavati as a romantic lover determined to immolate himself to give opportunity to his unfaithful
wife to start a new life of happiness and love with her paramour after convincing him that the only
honourable course open to him was to marry her and take over his children."

"He
is an experienced Naval Officer and not a sentimental hero of a novel. The reason therefore for
Nanavati going to Ahuja's flat must be something other than asking him for an explanation and to
ascertain his intention about marrying his wife and looking after the children. Then, according to Nanavati, he drove his wife and children to cinema, and promising them to come
and pick them up at the end of the show at about 6 p. m., he drove straight to his ship."

"He would say
that he went to his ship to get medicine for his seek dog. Though ordinarily this statement would be
insignificant, in the context of the conduct of Nanavati, it acquires significance. In the beginning of
his evidence, he says that on the morning of the day of the incident he and his wife took out their
sick dog to the Parel Animal Hospital."
"At Ahuja's office he went in keeping the revolver in the car,
and asked Talaja, the Sales Manager of Universal Motors of which Ahuja was the proprietor whetherK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961

"Before leaving Ahuja's office, the accused
looked for Ahuja in the Show Room, but Ahuja was not there. In the cross examination no question
was put to Nanavati in regard to his statement that he kept the revolver in the car when he entered
Ahuja's office. On the basis of this statement, it is contended that if Nanavati had intended to shoot
Ahuja he would have taken the revolver inside Ahuja's office."

might well have been that he would have gone to Ahuja's office not to shoot him there but to
ascertain whether he had left the office for his flat."
"It is also in evidence that Ahuja had no licence for revolver and no revolver of his
was found in his bed-room. In the circumstances, we must say that Sylvia was only attempting to
help Nanavati in his defence. We think that the evidence of Nanavati supported by that of Sylvia was
a collusive attempt on their part to explain away the otherwise serious implication of Nanavati
carrying the loaded revolver into the bed-room of Ahuja."

help Nanavati in his defence. We think that the evidence of Nanavati supported by that of Sylvia was
a collusive attempt on their part to explain away the otherwise serious implication of Nanavati
carrying the loaded revolver into the bed-room of Ahuja. That part of the version of the accused in
regard to the manner of his entry into the bed- room of Ahuja, was also supported by the evidence of
Anjani (P.W."
"8), the bearer, and Deepak, the Cook. Anjani opened the door of the flat to Nanavati at
about 4-20 p. m. He served tea to his master at about 4-15 P. M. Ahuja then telephoned to ascertain
the correct time and then went to his bed-room. About five minutes thereafter this witness went to
the bed-room of his master to bring back the tea-tray from there, and at that time his master went
into the bath-room for his bath."
"Thereafter, Anjani went to the kitchen and was preparing tea when
he heard the door-bell. He then opened the door to Nanavati. This evidence shows that at about
4-20 P.M. Ahuja was taking his bath in the bath-room and immediately thereafter Nanavati entered
the bed-room."
"He then opened the door to Nanavati. This evidence shows that at about
4-20 P.M. Ahuja was taking his bath in the bath-room and immediately thereafter Nanavati entered
the bed-room. Deepak, the cook of Ahuja, also heard the ringing of the door-bell."
"These two witnesses are natural witnesses and they have been examined by theK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 36police on the same day and nothing has been elicited against them to discredit their evidence. The
small discrepancies in their evidence do not in any way affect their credibility."
"A few seconds
thereafter, Mammie, the sister of the deceased, heard the crack of the window pane. The time that
elapsed between Nanavati entering the bed-room of Ahuja and her hearing the noise was about 15 to
20 seconds. She describes the time that elapsed between the two events as the time taken by her to
take up her saree from the door of her dressing-room and her coming to the bed-room door."
"She describes the time that elapsed between the two events as the time taken by her to
take up her saree from the door of her dressing-room and her coming to the bed-room door. Nanavati in his evidence says that he was in the bed-room of Ahuja for about 30 to 60 seconds. Whether it was 20 seconds, as Miss Mammie says, or 30 to 60 seconds, as Nanavati deposes, the
entire incident of shooting took place in a few seconds."
"Nanavati in his evidence says that he was in the bed-room of Ahuja for about 30 to 60 seconds. Whether it was 20 seconds, as Miss Mammie says, or 30 to 60 seconds, as Nanavati deposes, the
entire incident of shooting took place in a few seconds. Immediately after the sounds were heard, Anjani and Miss Mammie entered the bed-room and saw
the accused."
"Immediately after the sounds were heard, Anjani and Miss Mammie entered the bed-room and saw
the accused. The evidence discussed so far discloses clearly that Sylvia confessed to Nanavati of her illicit
intimacy with Ahuja; that Nanavati went to his ship at about 3.30 P.M. and took a revolver and six
rounds on a false pretext and loaded the revolver with six rounds; that thereafter he went to the
office of Ahuja to ascertain his whereabouts, but was told that Ahuja had left for his house; that the
accused then went to the flat of the deceased at about 4-20 P.M.; that he entered the flat and then
the bed-room unceremoniously with the loaded revolver, closed the door behind him and a few
seconds thereafter sounds were heard by Miss Mammie, the sister of the deceased, and Anjani,
servant; that when Miss Mammie and Anjani entered the bed-room, they saw the accused with the
revolver in his hand and found Ahuja lying on the floor of the bath-room. This conduct of the
accused to say the least, is very damaging for the defence and indeed in itself ordinarily sufficient to
implicate him in the murder of Ahuja."

admitted that he saw a servant in the room, though he did not know him by name; he also saw Miss
Mammie in the room."

admitted that he saw a servant in the room, though he did not know him by name; he also saw Miss
Mammie in the room. These small discrepancies, therefore, do not really affect their credibility."
"These small discrepancies, therefore, do not really affect their credibility. In
effect any substance both saw Nanavati with a fire-arm in his hand-though one said pistol and the
other gun-going away from the room without explaining to Miss Mammie his conduct and even
threatening Anjani. This could only be the conduct of a person who had committed a deliberate
murder and not of one who had shot the deceased by accident."
"Learned counsel for the accused argues that in the circumstances in which the accused was placed
soon after the accidental shooting he could not have convinced Miss Mammie with any amount of
explanation and therefore there was no point in seeking to explain his conduct to her. But whether
Miss Mammie would have been convinced by his explanation or not, if Nanavati had shot the
deceased by accident, he would certainly have told her particularly when he knew her before and
when she happened to be the sister of the man shot at. Assuming that the suddenness of the
accidental shooting had so benumbed his senses that he failed to explain the circumstances of the
shooting to her, the same cannot be said when he met others at the gate."
"At that time Anjani was standing in front of the car and Deepak
was a few feet away. Nanavati says in his evidence that it was not true that he told Puransingh that
he had killed the deceased as the latter had ""connection"" with his wife and that the whole idea was
quite absurd. Puransingh is not shaken in his cross-examination."
"We also do not think that the two witnesses are so intelligent as to visualize the possible defence andK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961

crime; he was not a hardened criminal and must have had a moral conviction that he was justified in
doing what he did."
"It was quite natural, therefore, for him to confess his guilt and justify his act to
the watchman who stopped him and asked him to wait there till the police came. In the mood in
which Nanavati was soon after the shooting, artificial standards of status or position would not have
weighed in his mind if he was going to confess and surrender to the police. We have gone through
the evidence of Puransingh and we do not see any justification to reject his evidence."

witness, without particulars, cannot detract from the clear evidence given by him in the
examination-in-chief. What Nanavati said to the question put by the Sessions Judge under s. 342 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure supports Samuel's version. The following question was put to him by the learned Sessions
Judge :
Q.-It is alleged against you that thereafter as aforesaid you went to Commander
Samuel at about 4-45 P.M. and told him that, something terrible had happened and
that you did not quite know but you thought that you shot a man as he had seduced

"Even if he had kept it there, how did Ahuja come to know that it
was a revolver for admittedly it was put in an envelope. Assuming that Ahuja had suspected that it
might be a revolver, how could he have caught the wrist of Nanavati who had by that time the
revolver in his hand with his finger on the trigger? Even if he was able to do so, how did Nanavati
accidental pull the trigger three times and release it three times when already Ahuja was holding his
wrist and when he was jerking his hand to release it from the grip of Ahuja ?"

rather curious that both the combatants did not use their left hands in the struggle."
"So too, if there was a struggle, why there
was no bruise on the body of the accused ? Though Nanavati says that there were some ""roughings""
on his wrist, he had not mentioned that fact till he gave his evidence in the court, nor is there any
evidence to indicate such ""roughings"". It is not suggested that the Clothes worn by the accused were
torn or even soiled."

deceased would have slumped down after the infliction of injury No."
"It is, therefore,
impossible that after either of the said two injuries was inflicted, the deceased could have still kept
on struggling with the accused. Indeed, Nanavati says in his evidence that at the first shot the
deceased just kept on hanging to his hand, but suddenly he let go his grip and slumped down. The only circumstance that could be relied upon to indicate a struggle is that one of the chappals of
the deceased was found in the bed-room while the other was in the bath-room."
"It is said that if the accused went to the bedroom of Ahuja to shoot him he would not have addressed
him by his first names ""Prem"" as deposed by Deepak. But Nanavati says in his evidence that he
would be the last person to address the deceased as Prem. This must have been an embellishment
on the part of Deepak."
"Assuming he said it, it does not indicate and sentiment of affection or
goodwill towards the deceased- admittedly he had none towards him-but only an involuntary and
habitual expression. It is argued that Nanavati is a good shot- Nanda, D.W. 6, a Commodore in the Indian Navy, certifies
that he is a good shot in regard to both moving and stationary targets-and therefore if he had
intended to shoot Ahuja, he would have shot him perpendiculary hitting the chest and not in a
haphazard way as the injuries indicate. Assuming that accused is a good shot, this argument ignores
that he was not shooting at an inanimate target for practice but was shooting to commit murder;
and it also ignores the desperate attempts the deceased must have made to escape."
"He also saysK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 46that the charring around the wound could occur with the weapon of the type we are now concerned
within about 2 to 3 inches of the muzzle of the weapon and the blackening around the wound
described as carbonaceous tattooing could be caused from such a revolver up to about 6 to 8 inches
from the muzzle. In the cross examination he says that the flattening of the two damaged bullets,
Exs."
"This evidence, therefore, establishes
that the bullets went off the revolver brought by the accused-indeed this is not disputed and that in
the course of the struggle of a few seconds as described by the accused, it is not possible that the
trigger could have been accidentally pulled three times in quick succession so as to discharge three
bullets.K. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961

put it at 11 to 14 pounds."
"But the same author in an earlier book from which we have already quoted puts it at
18 inches. In the book ""Recent Advances in Forensic Medicine"" 2nd Edn., p. 11, it is stated:K. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961

there was no carbonaceous tattooing on the injury, it must have been f caused by the revolver being
fired from a distance ra of over 18 inches from the tip of the mouth of the muzzle."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 51have been caused by a ricocheted bullet, he answered that though a ricocheted bullet coming from
the same line of direction could have caused the said injury, it could not have caused the intracranial
haemorrhage and also could not have cause the fracture of tho inner table of the skull. He is definite
that injury No."

"Though he
asserts that at a range of about 12 inches the wound does not show as a rule evidence of powder
mark, he admits that he has no practical experience that beyond a distance of 12 inches no powderK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961

still sticks to his opinion; but finally he admits that he is not a ballistics expert and has no
experience in that line."
"Dr. Baliga contradicts Dr. Jhala even inK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 54regard to these wounds. He says that these injuries, along with the others, indicate the probability of
a struggle between the victim and the assailant over the weapon; but he does not give any reasons
for his opinion."
"6 found on the back of the deceased viz, a
vertical abrasion in the right shoulder blade of dimensions 3""x1"" just outside the spine, and it is said
that the injury must have been caused when the accused pushed the deceased towards the door of
the bath room. Nanavati in his evidence says that he ""banged"" him towards the door of the
bath-room, and after some struggle he again pushed the deceased into the bath-room. It is
suggested that when the accused ""banged"" the deceased towards the door of the bath-room or when
he pushed him again into the bath-room, this injury might have been caused by his back having
come into contact with the frame of the door."
"It is thus more probable that the injury was caused
when the deceased's back came into contact either with the edge of the door or the
edge of the bathtub or the commode when he slumped.""K. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 55It is not possible to say definitely how this injury was caused, but it could have been caused when the
deceased fell down in the bath-room. The injuries found on the dead-body of Ahuja are certainly consistent with the accused intentionally
shooting him after entering the bed-
are wholly inconsistent with the accused accidentally shooting him in the course of their struggle for
the revolver."
"The said Exception reads:
""Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of
self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who
gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident"".K. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 56Homicide is the killing of a human being by another. Under this exception, culpable homicide is not
murder if the following conditions are complied with : (1) The deceased must have given
provocation to the accused."
"In short, the mode of resentment must bear aK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 58usefully be quoted :
""But the law requires two things : first that there should be that provocation; and
secondly, that the fatal blow should be clearly traced to the influence of passion
arising from that provocation."" The passages extracted above lay down the following principles: (1) Except in circumstances of most
extreme and exceptional character, a mere confession of adultery is not enough to reduce the offence
of murder to manslaughter."
"The same learned Judge in a
later decision in Boya Munigadu v. The Queen upheld plea of grave and sudden provocation in theK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 59following circumstances: The accused saw the deceased when she had cohabitation with his bitter
enemy; that night he had no meals; next morning he went to the ryots to get his wages from them,
and at that time he saw his wife eating food along with her paramour; he killed the paramour with a
bill-hook. The learned Judges held that the accused had sufficient provocation to bring the case
within the first exception to s. 300 of the Indian Penal Code."
"We must take intoK. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra on 24 November, 1961

should be looked at as one prolonged agony on the part of the husband which must

her death."" A division bench of the Allahabad High Court in Emperor v. Balku invoked the exception in a case
where the accused and the deceased, who was his wife's sister's husband, were sleeping on the same
cot, and in the night the accused saw the deceased getting up from the cot, and going to another
room and having sexual intercourse with his (accused's) wife, and the accused allowed the deceased
to return to the cot, but after the deceased fell asleep, he stabbed him to death."
