indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 2his conclusion  on the  ground that  no reasonable
body of  persons could come to the conclusion that
jury had  arrived at. on appeal  to this court by
special leave  it was  contended on  behalf of the
appellant  that  under  s.  307   of  the  code  of
criminal procedure  it was  incumbent on  the high
court to decide the competency of the reference on
a perusal  of the  order of reference itself since
it had no jurisdiction to go into the evidence for
that  purpose,   that  the   high  court  was  not
empowered by  s. 307(3)  of the  code to set aside
the verdict  of the  jury on the ground that there
were misdirections  in the charge, that there were
no misdirections in the charge nor was the verdict
perverse and that since there was grave and sudden
provocation the  offence committed if any, was not
E1 but  culpable  homicide  not  amounting  to
E1."
"there is nothing in s. 307(1)
of the  code that  lends support to the contention

high court either to acquit or convict the accused
after considering  the entire evidence, giving due

special leave arises out of the judgment of the bombay high court sentencing nanavati, the
appellant, to life imprisonment for the E1 of prem bhagwandas ahuja, a businessman of
bombay. this appeal presents the commonplace problem of an alleged E1 by an enraged husband of a
paramour of his wife: but it aroused considerable interest in the public mind by reason of the
publicity it received and the important constitutional point it had given rise to at the time of its
admission."

along with his sister, in a building called ""shreyas"" till 1957 and thereafter in another building called
""jivan jyot"" in setalvad road. in the year 1956, agniks, who were common friends of nanavatis and
ahujas, introduced ahuja and his sister to nanavatis. ahuja was unmarried and was about 34 years
of age at the time of his death, nanavati, as a naval officer, was frequently going away from bombay

the sessions judge, who convicts the accused; thereafter the accused will have a right of appeal
wherein he can attack the validity of his conviction on the ground that there were misdirections in
the charge of the jury."
"but s. 418 of the code provides:

now concerned. section 423 confers certain powers on an appellate court in the matter of disposing
of an appeal, such as calling for the record, hearing of the pleaders, and passing appropriate orders
therein."
"but in 1882 the section was amended and under the amended
section the condition for reference was that the high court should differ from the jury completely;
but in the code of 1893 the section was amended practically in terms as it now appears in the code.k. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 11the history of the legislation shows that the section was intended as a safeguard against erroneous
verdicts of inexperienced furors and also indicates the clear intention of the legislature to confer on
a high court a separate jurisdiction, which for convenience may be described as ""reference
jurisdiction"". section 307 of the code of criminal procedure, while continuing the benefits of the
jury system to persons tried by a court of session, also guards against any possible injustice, having
regard to the conditions obtaining in india."
"in that case the judicial committee relied upon the words ""ends of
justice"" end held that the verdict was one which no reasonable body of men could have, reached on
the evidence and further laid down that the requirements of the ends of justice must be the
determining factor both for the sessions judge in making the reference and for the high court in
disposing of it. the judicial committee observed:k. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 12""in general, if the evidence is such that it can properly support a verdict either of
guilty or not guilty, according to the view taken of it by the trial court, and if the jury
take one view of the evidence and the judge thinks that they should have taken the
other, the view of the jury. must prevail, since they are the judges of fact."
"it also defined the scope of its jurisdiction and its limitations the high court cank. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 13acquit or convict an accused of an offence of which the jury could have convicted him, and also pass
such sentence as might have been passed by the court of session. but before doing so, it shall
consider the entire evidence and give due weight to the opinions of the sessions judge and the jury."
"this argument is built upon the hypothesis that under the
code of criminal procedure there is a clear demarcation of the functions of the jury and the judge,
the jury dealing with facts and the judge with the and therefore the high court could set aside a
verdict on the ground of misdirection only when an appeal comes to it under s. 418 and could only
interfere with the verdict of the jury for the ends of justice, as interpreted by the privy council, whenk. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 14the matter comes to it under 8. 307 (3)."
"the decisions cited at the bar do not in any way sustain in narrow construction sought to be placed
by learned counsel on s. 307 of the code. in ramanugrah singh's case (1), which have been referred
to earlier, the judicial committee described the wide amplitude of the power of the high court in
the following terms:k. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 15""the court must consider the whole case and give due weight to the opinions of the
sessions judge and jury, and than acquit or convict the accused."" the judicial committee took care to observe:
"".... the test of reasonableness on the part of the jury may not be conclusive in every
case."
"but the sessions judge
recorded his judgment of acquittal in respect of the latter charges in agreement with the jury andk. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 16referred the case to the high court only in respect of the former. this court held that the said
procedure violated sub-s. (2) of s. 307 of the code of criminal procedure and also had the effect of
preventing the high court from considering the entire evidence against the accused and exercising
its jurisdiction under sub-s. (3) of s. 307 of the said code."

indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 17exercise any of the procedural powers appropriate to the occasion, such as, issuing of
notice, calling for records, remanding the case, ordering a retrial, etc. we therefore,
reject the first contention of learned counsel for the appellant."

circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the indian penal code
(xlv of 1860) or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same
code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the court shall presume the absence of
such circumstances."""
"this
presumption may also be rebutted by admissions made or circumstances elicited by
the evidence led by the prosecution or by the combined effect of such circumstancesk. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 19and the evidence adduced by the accused. but the section does not in any way affect
the burden that lies on the prosecution to prove all the ingredients of the offence with
which the accused is charged: that burden never shifts."
"the failure on the part of the
accused to establish all the circumstances bringing his case under the exception does not absolve the
prosecution to prove the ingredients of the offence; indeed, the evidence, though insufficient to
establish the exception, may be sufficient to negative one or more of the ingredients of the offence.k. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 20the english decisions relied upon by mr. pathak, learned counsel for the accused, may not be of
much help in construing the provisions of s. 105 of the indian evidence act. we would, therefore,
prefer not to refer to them, except to one of the leading decisions on the subject, namely,
woolmington v. the director of public prosecutions."
"in that case, two persons
were prosecuted, one for performing an illegal operation and the other for abetting him in thatk. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 21crime. under s. 106 of the ordinance 14 of 1895 in the ceylon code, which corresponds to s. 106 of
the indian evidence act, it was enacted that when any fact was especially within the knowledge of
any person, the burden of proving that fact was upon him."
"in
paragraph 6 of the charge, the learned sessions judge stated:
""before i proceed further i have to point out another section which is sectionk. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 2280. you know by now that the defence of the accused is that the firing of the revolver
was a matter of accident during a E5 for possession of the revolver."
"in such circumstances, we cannot predicate that the jury
understood the legal implications of s. 80 of the indian penal code and the scope of the burden ofk. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 23proof under s. 105 of the evidence act, and gave their verdict correctly. nor can we say that the jury
understood the distinction between the ingredients of the offence and the circumstances that attract
s. 80 of the indian penal code and the impact of the proof of some of the said circumstances on the
proof of the ingredients of the offence."
"if, on the other hand, the case is
one in which the view might fairly be taken (a) that a reasonable person, in
consequence of the provocation received, might be so rendered subject to passion or
loss of control as to be led to use the violence with fatal results, and (b) that the
accused was in fact acting under the stress of such provocation, then it is for the jury
to determine whether on its view of the facts manslaughter or E1 is the
appropriate verdict."" viscount simon brought out the distinction between the respective duties of the judge and the jury
succinctly by formulating the following questions:k. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 24""the distinction, therefore, is between asking 'could the evidence support the view
that the provocation was sufficient to lead a reasonable person to do what the
accused did ?' (which is for the judge to rule), and, assuming that the judge's ruling is
in affirmative, asking the jury: 'do you consider that, on the facts as you find them
from the evidence, the provocation was in fact enough to lead a reasonable person to
do what the accused did ?'"
"these facts
must lead to one conclusion and one only namely the guilt of the accused and lastly it
must exclude all reasonable hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the accused,k. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 25all reasonable hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the accused should be
excluded. in other words you must come to the conclusion by all the human
probability, it must be the accused and the accused only who must have committed
this crime."
"finally the learned sessions judge told them:
""if on the other hand you think that the circumstances on which the prosecution
relies are fully and firmly established, that they lead to one and the only conclusion
and one only, of the guilt of the accused and that they exclude all reasonable
hypothesis of the innocence of the accused then and in that case it will be your duty
which you are bound by the oath to bring verdict accordingly without any fear or any
favour and without regard being had to any consequence that this verdict might lead
to.""k. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 26mr. pathak contends that the learned sessions judge dealt with the evidence in two parts, in one
part he explained to the jury the well settled rule of approach to circumstantial evidence, whereas in
another part he clearly and definitely pointed to the jury the great evidentially value of the
E13 of guilt by the accused made to puransingh, if that was believed by them."
"in these circumstances
we must hold, agreeing with the high court, that this is a grave misdirection affecting the
correctness of the verdict. the next misdirection relied upon by the high court is the circumstance that the three letters
written by sylvia were not read to the jury by the learned sessions judge in his charge and that the
jury were not told of their effect on the credibility of the evidence of sylvia and nanavati. shelat, j.,
observed in regard to this circumstance thus:
""it cannot be gainsaid that these letters were important documents disclosing the
state of mind of mrs. nanavati and the deceased to a certain extent."

this context reliance is placed upon two english decisions, namely, r. v. roberts (1) and r. v.

omission by a judge to place before the jury certain evidence amounts to a misdirection or not falls

"in the statement taken by mokashi it was not recorded that

was in the witness-box to a question put to him in cross-examination he answered that puransingh
did not tell him that he had asked nanavati why he killed ahuja and that the accused replied that he
had a E8 with the deceased as the latter had ""connections"" with his wife and that he had killed
him. the learned sessions judge not only allowed the evidence to go in but also, in paragraph 18 of
his charge to the jury, referred to that statement."
"after giving the summary of the evidence given by
puransingh, the learned sessions judge proceeded to state in his charge to the jury:
""now the conversation between him and phansalkar (sub-inspector) was brought on
record in which what the chowkidar told sub- inspector phansalkar was, the servants
of the flat of miss ahuja had informed him that a naval officer was going away in the

car saying that he was A27 station and to sub-inspector phansalkar he

had told this also to sub-inspector phansalkar."

"but, as we have heard
counsel at great length, we propose to discuss the evidence.k. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 32we shall now proceed to consider the evidence in the case. the evidence can be divided into three
parts, namely, (i) evidence relating to the conduct of the accused before the E2 incident, (ii)
evidence in regard to the conduct of the accused after the incident, and (iii) evidence in regard to the
actual E2 in the bed-room of ahuja."
"it appears to us that this is clearly a made-up
conversation and an unnatural one too. is it likely that nanavati, who says in his evidence that prior
to april 27, 1959, he did not think that his wife was unfaithful to him, would have suddenly thought
that she had a lover on the basis of a trivial circumstance of her being unresponsive when he put his
arm around her affectionately ? her coldness towards him might have been due to many reasons."
"her coldness towards him might have been due to many reasons. unless he had a suspicion earlier or was informed by somebody that she was unfaithful to him, this
conduct of nanavati in suspecting his wife on the basis of the said circumstance does not appear to
be the natural reaction of a husband. the recollection of her preference to attend the dinner given by
miss mammie to that of his brother, in the absence of an earlier suspicion or information, could not
have flashed on his mind the image of ahuja as a possible lover of his wife."
"if the E12 of illicit
intimacy between sylvia and ahuja was made so suddenly at lunch time, even if she had purchased
the tickets, it is not likely that he would have taken her and the children to the cinema. nanavati
then proceeds to say in his evidence : on his wife admitting her E15 with ahuja, he was
absolutely stunned; he then got up and said that he must go and settle the matter with the swine; he
asked her what were the intentions of ahuja and whether ahuja was prepared to marry her and look
after the children; he wanted an explanation from ahuja for his caddish conduct. in the
cross-examination he further elaborated on his intentions thus : he thought of having the matters
settled with ahuja; he would find out from him whether he would take an honourable way out of thek."

indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 33situation; and he would thrash him if he refused to do so. the honourable course which he expected
of the deceased was to marry his wife and look after the children."
"he made it clear further that when
he went to see ahuja the main thing in his mind was to find out what ahuja's intentions were
towards his wife and children and to find out the explanation for his conduct. sylvia in her evidence
says that when she confessed her unfaithfulness to nanavati the latter suddenly got up rather
excitedly and said that he wanted to go to ahuja's flat and square up the things. briefly stated,
nanavati, according to him, went to ahuja's flat to ask for an explanation for seducing his wife and
to find out whether he would marry sylvia and take care of the children."
"sylvia in her evidence

nanavati, according to him, went to ahuja's flat to ask for an explanation for seducing his wife and
to find out whether he would marry sylvia and take care of the children. is it likely that a person,
situated as anavati was, would have reacted in the manner stated by him?"
"but it is most improbable, even impossible, that a husband who has been deceived by his
wife would voluntarily go to the house of his wife's paramour to ascertain his intentions, and, what
is more, to ask him to take charge of his children. what was the explanation nanavati wanted to get
from ahuja ? his wife confessed that she had E15 with ahuja."
"there was no question of ahuja seducing an innocent girl, but both
ahuja and sylvia must have been willing parties to the E15 between them. that apart, it is
clear from the evidence that ahuja and sylvia had decided to marry and, therefore, no further
elucidation of the intention of ahuja by nanavati was necessary at all. it is true that nanavati says in
his evidence that when he asked her whether ahuja was prepared to marry her and look after the
children, she did not give any proper reply; and sylvia also in her evidence says that when her
husband asked her whether ahuja was willing to marry her and look after the children she avoided
answering that question as she was too ashamed to admit that ahuja was trying to back out from the
promise to marry her."

answering that question as she was too ashamed to admit that ahuja was trying to back out from the
promise to marry her. that this version is not true is amply borne out by the letters written by sylvia
to ahuja."
"i am torturingk. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 34myself in every possible way as you asked, so that, there will be no surprise afterwards"". this letter clearly demonstrates that she agreed not to see ahuja for a month, not because that
ahuja refused to marry her, but because it was settled that they should marry, and that in view of
the far-reaching effects of the separation from her husband on her future life and that of her
children, the lovers wanted to live separately to judge for themselves whether they really loved each
other so much as to marry."
"we have no doubt that her
evidence, not only in regard to the question of marriage but also in regard to other matters, indicates
that having lost her lover, out of necessity or out of deep penitence for her past misbehavior, she is
out to help he husband in his defence. this correspondence belies the entire story that sylvia did not
reply to nanavati when the latter asked her whether ahuja was willing to marry her and that was the
reason why nanavati wanted to visit ahuja to ask him about him intentions. we cannot visualize
nanavati as a romantic lover determined to immolate himself to give opportunity to his unfaithful
wife to start a new life of happiness and love with her paramour after convincing him that the only
honourable course open to him was to marry her and take over his children."

"he
is an experienced naval officer and not a sentimental hero of a novel. the reason therefore for
nanavati going to ahuja's flat must be something other than asking him for an explanation and to
ascertain his intention about marrying his wife and looking after the children. then, according to nanavati, he drove his wife and children to cinema, and promising them to come
and pick them up at the end of the show at about 6 p. m., he drove straight to his ship."

that he went to his ship to get medicine for his seek dog."
"he would say
that he went to his ship to get medicine for his seek dog. though ordinarily this statement would be
insignificant, in the context of the conduct of nanavati, it acquires significance. in the beginning of
his evidence, he says that on the morning of the day of the incident he and his wife took out their
sick dog to the parel animal hospital."

and asked talaja, the sales manager of universal motors of which ahuja was the proprietor whetherk. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961

"before leaving ahuja's office, the accused
looked for ahuja in the show room, but ahuja was not there. in the cross examination no question
was put to nanavati in regard to his statement that he kept the revolver in the car when he entered
ahuja's office. on the basis of this statement, it is contended that if nanavati had intended to shoot
ahuja he would have taken the revolver inside ahuja's office."

might well have been that he would have gone to ahuja's office not to shoot him there but to
ascertain whether he had left the office for his flat."
"it is also in evidence that ahuja had no licence for revolver and no revolver of his
was found in his bed-room. in the circumstances, we must say that sylvia was only attempting to
help nanavati in his defence. we think that the evidence of nanavati supported by that of sylvia was
a collusive attempt on their part to explain away the otherwise serious implication of nanavati
carrying the loaded revolver into the bed-room of ahuja."

help nanavati in his defence. we think that the evidence of nanavati supported by that of sylvia was
a collusive attempt on their part to explain away the otherwise serious implication of nanavati
carrying the loaded revolver into the bed-room of ahuja. that part of the version of the accused in
regard to the manner of his entry into the bed- room of ahuja, was also supported by the evidence of
anjani (p.w."
"8), the bearer, and deepak, the cook. anjani opened the door of the flat to nanavati at
about T6 he served tea to his master at about 4-15 p. m. ahuja then telephoned to ascertain
the correct time and then went to his bed-room. about five minutes thereafter this witness went to
the bed-room of his master to bring back the tea-tray from there, and at that time his master went
into the bath-room for his bath."
"thereafter, anjani went to the kitchen and was preparing tea when
he heard the door-bell. he then opened the door to nanavati. this evidence shows that at about
4-20 p.m. ahuja was taking his bath in the bath-room and immediately thereafter nanavati entered
the bed-room."
"he then opened the door to nanavati. this evidence shows that at about
4-20 p.m. ahuja was taking his bath in the bath-room and immediately thereafter nanavati entered
the bed-room. deepak, the cook of ahuja, also heard the ringing of the door-bell."
"these two witnesses are natural witnesses and they have been examined by thek. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 36police on the same day and nothing has been elicited against them to discredit their evidence. the
small discrepancies in their evidence do not in any way affect their credibility."
"a few seconds
thereafter, mammie, the sister of the deceased, heard the crack of the window pane. the time that
elapsed between nanavati A14 of ahuja and her hearing the noise was about 15 to
20 seconds. she describes the time that elapsed between the two events as the time taken by her to
take up her saree from the door of her dressing-room and her coming to the bed-room door."
"she describes the time that elapsed between the two events as the time taken by her to
take up her saree from the door of her dressing-room and her coming to the bed-room door. nanavati in his evidence says that he was in the bed-room of ahuja for about T9 whether it was 20 seconds, as miss mammie says, or T9 as nanavati deposes, the
entire incident of E2 took place in a few seconds."
"nanavati in his evidence says that he was in the bed-room of ahuja for about T9 whether it was 20 seconds, as miss mammie says, or T9 as nanavati deposes, the
entire incident of E2 took place in a few seconds. immediately after the sounds were heard, anjani and miss mammie entered the bed-room and saw
the accused."
"immediately after the sounds were heard, anjani and miss mammie entered the bed-room and saw
the accused. the evidence discussed so far discloses clearly that sylvia confessed to nanavati of her illicit
intimacy with ahuja; that nanavati went to his ship at about 3.30 p.m. and took a revolver and six
rounds on a false pretext and loaded the revolver with six rounds; that thereafter he went to the
office of ahuja to ascertain his whereabouts, but was told that ahuja had left for his house; that the
accused then went to the flat of the deceased at about 4-20 p.m.; that he entered the flat and then
the bed-room unceremoniously with the loaded revolver, closed the door behind him and a few
seconds thereafter sounds were heard by miss mammie, the sister of the deceased, and anjani,
servant; that when miss mammie and anjani entered the bed-room, they saw the accused with the
revolver in his hand and found ahuja lying on the floor of the bath-room. this conduct of the
accused to say the least, is very damaging for the defence and indeed in itself ordinarily sufficient to
implicate him in the E1 of ahuja."

admitted that he saw a servant in the room, though he did not know him by name; he also saw miss
mammie in the room. these small discrepancies, therefore, do not really affect their credibility."
"these small discrepancies, therefore, do not really affect their credibility. in
effect any substance both saw nanavati with a fire-arm in his hand-though one said pistol and the
other gun-going away from the room without explaining to miss mammie his conduct and even
threatening anjani. this could only be the conduct of a person who had committed a deliberate
E1 and not of one who had shot the deceased by accident."
"learned counsel for the accused argues that in the circumstances in which the accused was placed
soon after the E3 he could not have convinced miss mammie with any amount of
explanation and therefore there was no point in seeking to explain his conduct to her. but whether
miss mammie would have been convinced by his explanation or not, if nanavati had shot the
deceased by accident, he would certainly have told her particularly when he knew her before and
when she happened to be the sister of the man shot at. assuming that the suddenness of the
E3 had so benumbed his senses that he failed to explain the circumstances of the
E2 to her, the same cannot be said when he met others at the gate."
"at that time anjani was standing in front of the car and deepak
was a few feet away. nanavati says in his evidence that it was not true that he told puransingh that
he had killed the deceased as the latter had ""connection"" with his wife and that the whole idea was
quite absurd. puransingh is not shaken in his cross-examination."

"it was quite natural, therefore, for him to confess his guilt and justify his act to
the watchman who stopped him and asked him to wait there till the police came. in the mood in

was no bruise on the body of the accused ? though nanavati says that there were some ""roughings""
on his wrist, he had not mentioned that fact till he gave his evidence in the court, nor is there any
evidence to indicate such ""roughings"". it is not suggested that the clothes worn by the accused were
torn or even soiled."
"1 was alsok. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 45so serious that he could not stand for more than one or two minutes. even dr. baliga admits that the
deceased would have slumped down after the infliction of injury no."
"it is, therefore,
impossible that after either of the said two injuries was inflicted, the deceased could have still kept
on A19 with the accused. indeed, nanavati says in his evidence that at the first shot the
deceased just kept on hanging to his hand, but suddenly he let go his grip and slumped down. the only circumstance that could be relied upon to indicate a E5 is that one of the chappals of
the deceased was found in the bed-room while the other was in the bath-room."
"it is said that if the accused went to the bedroom of ahuja to shoot him he would not have addressed
him by his first names ""prem"" as deposed by deepak. but nanavati says in his evidence that he
would be the last person to address the deceased as prem. this must have been an embellishment
on the part of deepak."
"assuming he said it, it does not indicate and sentiment of affection or
goodwill towards the deceased- admittedly he had none towards him-but only an involuntary and
habitual expression. it is argued that nanavati is a good shot- nanda, d.w. 6, a commodore in the indian navy, certifies
that he is a good shot in regard to both moving and stationary targets-and therefore if he had
intended to shoot ahuja, he would have shot him perpendiculary hitting the chest and not in a
haphazard way as the injuries indicate. assuming that accused is a good shot, this argument ignores
that he was not E2 at an inanimate target for practice but was E2 to commit E1
and it also ignores the desperate attempts the deceased must have made to escape."
"he also saysk. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 46that the charring around the wound could occur with the weapon of the type we are now concerned
within about 2 to 3 inches of the muzzle of the weapon and the blackening around the wound
described as carbonaceous tattooing could be caused from such a revolver up to about 6 to 8 inches
from the muzzle. in the cross examination he says that the flattening of the two damaged bullets,
exs."
"this evidence, therefore, establishes
that the bullets went off the revolver brought by the accused-indeed this is not disputed and that in
the course of the E5 of a few seconds as described by the accused, it is not possible that the
trigger could have been accidentally pulled three times in quick succession so as to discharge three
bullets.k. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961

put it at 11 to 14 pounds."

there was no carbonaceous tattooing on the injury, it must have been f caused by the revolver being

that injury no."

"though he
asserts that at a range of about 12 inches the wound does not show as a rule evidence of powder

still sticks to his opinion; but finally he admits that he is not a ballistics expert and has no
experience in that line."

a E5 between the victim and the assailant over the weapon; but he does not give any reasons
for his opinion."
"6 found on the back of the deceased viz, a
vertical abrasion in the right shoulder blade of dimensions 3""x1"" just outside the spine, and it is said
that the injury must have been caused when the accused pushed the deceased towards the door of
the bath room. nanavati in his evidence says that he ""banged"" him towards the door of the
bath-room, and after some E5 he again pushed the deceased into the bath-room. it is
suggested that when the accused ""banged"" the deceased towards the door of the bath-room or when
he pushed him again into the bath-room, this injury might have been caused by his back having
come into contact with the frame of the door."
"it is thus more probable that the injury was caused
when the deceased's back came into contact either with the edge of the door or the
edge of the bathtub or the commode when he slumped.""k. m. nanavati vs state of maharashtra on 24 november, 1961
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1596139/ 55it is not possible to say definitely how this injury was caused, but it could have been caused when the
deceased fell down in the bath-room. the injuries found on the dead-body of ahuja are certainly consistent with the accused intentionally
E2 him after entering the bed-
are wholly inconsistent with the accused accidentally E2 him in the course of their E5 for
the revolver."
