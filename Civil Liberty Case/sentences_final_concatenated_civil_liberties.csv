"Telephone-Tapping is a serious invasion of an individual's privacy. With the growth of highly
sophisticated communication technology, the right to hold telephone conversation, in the privacy of
one's home or office without interference, is increasingly susceptible to abuse. It is no doubt correct
that every Government, howsoever democratic, exercises some degree of subrosa operation as a part
of its intelligence out-fit but at the same time citizen's right to privacy has to be protected from being
abused by the authorities of the day."
"2. This petition-public interest-under Article 32 of the Constitution of India has been filed by the
people's Union of Civil Liberties, a voluntary organisation, high lighting the incidents of telephone
tapping in the recent past. The petitioner has challenged the constitutional validity of Section 5(2) of
the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 (the Act), in the alternative it is contended that the said provisions
be suitably read-down to include procedural safeguards to rule out arbitrariness and to prevent the
indiscriminate telephone-tapping."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31276692/ 121. Investigation has revealed the following lapses on the part of MTNL
(i) In respect of 4 telephone numbers through they were shown to be under
interception in the statement supplied by MTNL, the authorisation for putting the
number under interception could not be provided. This shows that records have not
been maintained properly."
"This shows that records have not
been maintained properly. (ii) In respect of 279 telephone numbers, although authority letters from various authorised
agencies were available, these numbers have not been shown in list, supplied by MTNL showing
interception of telephones to the corresponding period. This shows that lists supplied were
incomplete."
"The
GM (O), MTNL in is explanation has said that this was done in good faith on oral requests of the
representatives of the competent authorities and that instructions have now been issued that
interception beyond authorised periods will be done only on receipt of written requests. (iv) In respect of 111 cases, interception of telephones have exceeded 180 days period and no
permission of Government for keeping the telephone under interception beyond 180 days was
taken. (v) The files pertaining to interception have not been maintained properly."
"22. Investigation has also revealed that various authorized agencies are not maintaining the files
regarding interception of telephones properly. One agency is not maintaining even the log books of
interception."
"One agency is not maintaining even the log books of
interception. The reasons for keeping a telephone number on watch have also not been maintained
properly. The effectiveness of the results of observation have to be reported to the Government in
quarterly returns which is also not being sent in time and does not contain all the relevant
information."
"The Assistant DirectorGeneral, Department of Telecom has filed counter affidavit on behalf of the
Union of India. The stand taken by the Union of India is as under:
The allegation that the party in power at the center/State or officer authorised to tap
the telephone by the Central/State Government could misuse this power is not
correct. Tapping of telephone could be done only by the Central/State Government
order by the Officer specifically authorised by the Central/State Government on their
behalf and it could be done only under certain conditions such as National
Emergency in the interest of public safety, security of State, public order etc."

necessary to record the reasons for tapping before tapping is resorted to."
"It is also
necessary to record the reasons for tapping before tapping is resorted to. If the party,
whose telephone is to be tapped is to be informed about this and also the reasons for
tapping, it will defeat the very purpose of tapping of telephone. By the very sensitive
nature of the work, it is absolutely necessary to maintain secrecy in the matter."

"Telephone-conversation is a part of modern man's life. It is considered so
important that more and more people are carrying mobile telephone instruments in their pockets. Telephone conversation is an important facet of a man's private life."
"Telephone conversation is an important facet of a man's private life. Right to privacy would certainly
include telephone-conversation in the privacy of one's home or office. Telephone-tapping would,
thus, infract Article 21 of the Constitution of India unless it is permitted under the procedure
established by law."
"This freedom means the right to express one's convictions and opinions freely by word
of mouth, writing, printing, picture, or in any other manner. When a person is talking on telephone,
he is exercising his right to freedom of speech and expression. Telephone-tapping unless it comes
within the grounds of restrictions under Article 19(2) would infract Article 19(1)(a) of the
Constitution."
"The expression ""public safety"" means the state or condition of freedom from danger or risk
for the people at large. When either of these two conditions are not in existence, the Central
Government or a State Government or the authorised officer cannot resort to telephone tapping
even though there is satisfaction that it is necessary or expedient so to do in the interests of
sovereignty and integrity of India etc. In other words, even if the Central Government is satisfied
that it is necessary or expedient so to do in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India or
the security of the State or friendly relations with sovereign States or public order or for preventing
incitement to the commission of an offence, it cannot intercept the messages or resort to telephone
tapping unless a public emergency has occurred or the interest of public safety or the existence of
the interest of public safety requires."

"32. The Second Press Commission in paras 164,165 and 166 of its report has commented on the
""tapping of telephones"" as under:
Tapping of Telephones

general and its editorial echelons in particular have to suffer tapping of telephones."

"165. Tapping of telephones is a serious invasion of privacy. It is a variety of
technological eavesdropping."
"It is a variety of
technological eavesdropping. Conversations on the telephone are often of an intimate
and confidential character. The relevant statue, i.e., Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, a
piece of ancient legislation, does not concern itself with tapping."
"There are instances where apprehensions
of disclosure of sources of information as well as the character of information may
result in constraints on freedom of information and consequential drying up of its
source. We, therefore, recommend that telephones may not be tapped except in the
interest of national security, public order, investigation of crime and similar
objectives, under orders made in writing by the Minister concerned or an officer of
rank to whom the power in that behalf is delegated. The order should disclose
reasons."
"The order should disclose
reasons. An order for tapping of telephones should expire after three months from
the date of the order. Moreover, within a period of six weeks the order should come
up for review before a Board constituted on the lines prescribed in statutes providing
for preventive detention."
"The decision of the Board should be binding on the
Government. It may be added that the Minister or his delegates will be competent to
issue a fresh order for tapping of the telephone if circumstances call for it. The
Telegraph Act should contain a clause to give effect to this recommendation."
"Data of this nature will help courts, if called upon, to determine the
presence or absence of mala fide in the withholding of telegrams. According to Mr. Sachar the only way to safeguard the right of privacy of an individual is that there
should be prior judicial scrutiny before any order for telephone-tapping is passed under Section 5(2)
of the Act. He states that such judicial scrutiny may be ex-parte."
"We, therefore, order and direct as under:
1. An order for telephone-tapping in terms of Section 5(2) of the Act shall not be
issued except by the Home Secretary, Government of India (Central Government)
and Home Secretaries of the State Governments. In an urgent case the power may be
delegated to an officer of the Home Department of the Government of India and the
State Governments not below the rank of Joint Secretary."
