"165. E3 is a serious invasion of privacy. it is a variety of
technological eavesdropping."
"it is a variety of
technological eavesdropping. conversations on the telephone are often of an intimate
and confidential character. the relevant statue, i.e., indian telegraph act, T3 a
piece of ancient legislation, does not concern itself with tapping."
"there are instances where apprehensions
of disclosure of sources of information as well as the character of information may
result in constraints on freedom of information and consequential drying up of its
source. we, therefore, recommend that telephones may not be tapped except in the
interest of national security, public order, E19 of crime and similar
objectives, under orders made in writing by the minister concerned or an officer of
rank to whom the power in that behalf is delegated. the order should disclose
reasons."
"the order should disclose
reasons. an order for E3 should expire after T13 from
the date of the order. moreover, within a period of T12 the order should come
up for review before a board constituted on the lines prescribed in statutes providing
for preventive detention."
"the decision of the board should be binding on the
government. it may be added that the minister or his delegates will be competent to
issue a fresh order for tapping of the telephone if circumstances call for it. the
telegraph act should contain a clause to give effect to this recommendation."
"data of this nature will help courts, if called upon, to determine the
presence or absence of mala fide in the withholding of telegrams. according to mr. sachar the only way to safeguard the right of privacy of an individual is that there
should be prior judicial scrutiny before any order for telephone-tapping is passed under section 5(2)
of the act. he states that such judicial scrutiny may be ex-parte."
"we, therefore, order and direct as under:
1. an order for telephone-tapping in terms of section 5(2) of the act shall not be
issued except by the home secretary, government of india (central government)
and home secretaries of the state governments. in an urgent case the power may be
delegated to an officer of the home department of the government of india and the
state governments not below the rank of joint secretary."
