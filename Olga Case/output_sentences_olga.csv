"The slum census conducted by the
Government of Maharashtra in 1976 shows that 79% of the slum-dwellers belonged
to the low income group with a monthly income below Rs.600.","'The Economic Survey of Maharashtra' published by the State
Government shows that the bulk of public investment was made in the cities of
Bombay, Pune and Thane, which created employment opportunities attracting the
starving rural population to those cities.","The study conducted

"The pavement-dwellers and the slum-dwellers
who constitute 50% of the population of Bombay, occupy only 25% of the city's

Bombay is not that there is no land on which homes can be built for them but, that

Bombay because they are employed in Bombay and they live on pavements because
there is no other place where they can live."

constitutional obligation to usher a socialistic society has no right to evict slum and
pavement-dwellers who constitute half of the city's population.","Apart from this, it is urged, the
restrictions which are sought to be imposed by the respondents on the use of
pavements by pavement-dwellers are not reasonable.","Therefore, sections
312,313 and 314 of the B.M.C."
"In so far as Article 21 is concerned,
no deprivation of life, either directly or indirectly, is involved in the eviction of the
slum and pavement-dwellers from public places.","Under

and are under the control of the Commissioner.","The Municipal Corporation is under
an obligation under section 314 of the B.M.C."
"As we have stated while summing up the petitioners' case, the main plank of their argument is that
the right to life which is guaranteed by Article 21 includes the right to livelihood and since, they will
be deprived of their livelihood if they are evicted from their slum and pavement dwellings, their
eviction is tantamount to deprivation of their life and is hence unconstitutional.","The petitions are clearly

opprobrious occupation or a nefarious trade or business, like tourism, gambling or living on the

"Counsel attempted to demonstrate the practical futility of issuing the
show cause notice by pointing out firstly, that the only answer which a pavement
dweller, for example, can make to such a notice is that he is compelled to live on the
pavement because he has no other place to go to and secondly, that it is hardly likely
that in pursuance of such a notice, pavement dwellers or slum dwellers would ask for
time to vacate since, on their own showing, they are compelled to occupy some
pavement or slum or the other if they are evicted.","We have indicated
above that far from so intending, the Legislature has left it to the discretion of the
Commissioner whether or not to give notice, a discretion which has to be exercised
reasonably.","It may be true to say that, in the
generality of cases, persons who have committed encroachments on pavements or on

hutment dwellers removed from the slums.","The same criterion would apply to the Kamraj Nagar Basti as
would apply to the dwellings constructed unauthorisedly on other roads and pavements in the city.","A census was accordingly carried out on January 4, 1976

to undertake 'Slum Upgradation Programme(SUP)' under which basic civic amenities would be
made available to the slum dwellers.","Under the Scheme, 85,000 small plots for construction
of houses would become available, out of which 40,000 would be in Greater Bombay, 25,00 in the
Thane-Kalyan area and 20,000 in the New Bombay region.","We trust that these Schemes, grandiose as they appear, will be
pursued faithfully and the aid obtained from the World Bank utilised systematically and effectively
for achieving its purpose."

degradation which it involves, eviction of slum and pavement dwellers is an ineffective remedy for
decongesting the cities.","Therefore, what is of crucial importance to the question of thinning out the squatters'
colonies in metropolitan cities is to create new opportunities for employment in the rural sector and
to spread the existing job opportunities evenly in urban areas.","In a highly readable and moving account of the problems which the poor

briefly, pavement dwellers who were censused or who happened to be censused in

identity cards and whose dwellings were numbered in the 1976 census must be given
alternate sites for their resettlement; slums which have been in existence for a long
time, say for twenty years or more, and which have been improved and developed will

required for a public purposes, in which case, alternate sites or accommodation will
be provided to them, the 'Low Income Scheme Shelter Programme' which is proposed
