     some  time   in  1981,   the  respondents  -  state  of
maharashtra and bombay municipal corporation took a decision
that all pavement dwellers and the slum or busti dwellers in
the city  of bombay will be evicted forcibly and deported to
their respective  places of  origin  or  removed  to  places
outside the  city of  bombay. pursuant to that decision, the
pavement dwellings  of some  of the petitioners were in fact
demolished by  the bombay municipal corporation."

the respondents  agreed that the huts will not be demolished
until october 15, 1981 and the writ petition was disposed of

removal of  encroachments from  pavements is  arbitrary  and
unreasonable since,  not only  does it  not provide  for the
giving of  a notice  before the  removal of  an encroachment
but, expressly  enables that  the municipal commissioner may
cause the  encroachments to be removed without notice , (iv)
that it  is constitutionally  impermissible to  characterise

"the undisputed fact
that even after eviction, the squatters return to the cities
affords proof  of  that  position. these  facts  constitute
empirical evidence to justify the conclusion that persons in
the position  of petitioners  live in slums and on pavements
because they  have small jobs to nurse in the city and there
is nowhere  else to  live. evidently, they choose a pavement

"the judgment of the court was delivered by :
chandrachud, cj. these writ petitions portray the plight of lakhs of persons
who live on pavements and in slums in the city of bombay. they constitute nearly
half the population of the city."
"they constitute nearly
half the population of the city. the first group of petitions relates to pavement
dwellers while the second group relates to both pavement and basti or slum dwellers. those who have made pavements their homes exist in the midst of filth and squalor,
which has to be seen to believed."
"they have no option but to flock to big
cities like bombay, which provide the means of bare subsistence. they only choose a
pavement or a slum which is nearest to their place of work. in a word, their plea is
that the right to life is illusory without a right to the protection of the means by which
alone life can be lived."
"he found a job in a chemical company at dahisar,
bombay, on a daily wage of rs-23 per day. a slum-lord extorted a sum of rs.2,50
from him in exchange of a shelter of plastic sheets and canvas on a pavement on the
western express highway, bombay. he lives in it with his wife and three daughters
who are 16, 13 and 5 years of age."
"the
petitioners also ask for a declaration that the provisions of sections 312, 313 and 314
of the bombay municipal corporation act, 1888 are in valid as violating articles 14,
19 and 21 of the constitution. the reliefs asked for in the two groups of writ petitions
are that the respondents should be directed to withdraw the decision to demolish the
pavement dwellings and the slum hutments and, where they are already demolished,
to restore possession of the sites to the former occupants. on behalf of the government of maharashtra, a counter- affidavit has been filed by v.s.munje,

"his case in paragraph 21 of his reply-affidavit seems to be that since, the
foot-paths are in the occupation of pavement dwellers for a long time, foot-paths have ceased to be
foot-paths. he says that the pavement dwellers and the slum or basti dwellers, who number about
47.7 lakhs, constitute about 50 per cent of the total population of greater bombay, that they supply
the major work force for bombay from menial jobs to the most highly skilled jobs, that they have
been living in the hutments for generations, that they have been making a significant contribution to
the economic life of the city and that, therefore, it is unfair and unreasonable on the part of the state
government and the municipal corporation to destroy their homes and deport them : a home is a

the government had decided to compile a list of slums which were required to be removed in public

improved and developed would not normally be demolished unless the land was required for a
public purpose. in the event that the land was so required, the policy of the state government was to
provide alternative accommodation to the slum dwellers who were censused and possessed identity
cards. this is borne out by a circular of the government dated february 4, T13 (no."
"41). shri gokak says that the state government has issued instructions directing, inter alia, that
""action to remove the slums excepting those which are on the foot-paths or roads or which are new
or casually located should not, therefore, be taken without obtaining approval from the government
to the proposal for the removal of such slums and their rehabilitation."" since, it was never the policy
of the government to encourage construction of hutments on foot- paths, pavements or other places
over which the public has a right of way, no census of such hutments was ever intended to be
conducted."
"the grievance
is that, as a result of this imbalance, there are not enough jobs available in the northern tip of the
city. the improvement of living conditions in the slums and the regional distribution of job
opportunities are the only viable remedies for relieving congestion of the population in the centre of
the city. the increase allowed by the state government in the floor space index over and above
1.33, has led to a further concentration of population in the centre of the city."
"the arguments advanced before us by ms. indira jaisingh, mr.
v.m. tarkunde and mr. ram jethmalani cover a wide range but the main thrust of the petitioners'
case is that evicting a pavement dweller or slum dweller from his habitat amounts to depriving of his
right to livelihood, which is comprehended in the right guaranteed by article 21 of the constitution
that no person shall be deprived of his life except according to procedure established by law. the
question of the guarantee of personal liberty contained in article 21 does not arise and was not
raised before us."
"it is contended that it is the
responsibility of the courts to reduce inequalities and social imbalances by striking down statutes
which perpetuate them. one of the grievances of the petitioners against the bombay municipal
corporation act, 1888 is that it is a century old antiquated piece of legislation passed in an era when
pavement dwellers and slum dwellers did not exist and the consciousness of the modern notion of a
welfare state was not present to the mind of the colonial legislature. according to the petitioners,
connected with these issues and yet independent of them, is the question of the role of the court in
setting the tone of values in a democratic society.olga tellis & ors vs bombay municipal corporation & ors."

indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/709776/ 18the argument which bears on the provisions of article 21 is elaborated by saying that the eviction of
pavement and slum dweller will lead, in a vicious circle, to the deprivation of their employment,
their livelihood and, therefore, to the right to life. our attention is drawn in this behalf to an extract
from the judgment of douglas j in baksey v. board of regents, 347 m.d."
"to work means to eat and it also means to live."" the right to live and the right to work are integrated and interdependent and, therefore, if a person
is deprived of his job as a result of his eviction from a slum or a pavement, his very right to life is put
in jeopardy. it is urged that the economic compulsions under which these persons are forced to live
in slums or on pavements impart to their occupation the character of a fundamental right."

in slums or on pavements impart to their occupation the character of a fundamental right. it is further urged by the petitioners that it is constitutionally impermissible to characterise the
pavement dwellers as ""trespassers"" because, their occupation of pavements arises from economic
compulsions."
"'the economic survey of maharashtra' published by the state
government shows that the bulk of public investment was made in the cities of
bombay, pune and thane, which created employment opportunities attracting the
starving rural population to those cities. the slum census conducted by the
government of maharashtra in T13 shows that 79% of the slum-dwellers belonged
to the low income group with a monthly income below rs.600. the study conducted
by p. ramachandran of the tata institute of social sciences shows that in 1972,91%
of the pavement dwellers had a monthly income of less than rs.200."
"the principal public housing sectors in maharashtra, namely, the maharashtra
housing and area development agency (mhada) and the city and industrial
development corporation of maharashtra ltd. (cidco) have been able to construct
only 3000 and 1000 units respectively as against the annual need of 60,000 units. in
any event, the cost of housing provided even by these public sector agencies is beyond
the means of the slum and pavement- dwellers. under the urban land (ceiling and
regulation) act T28 private land owners and holders are given facility to provide
housing to the economically weaker sections of the society at a stipulated price of
rs.90 per sq.ft., which also is beyond the means of the slum and pavement-dwellers."

housing to the economically weaker sections of the society at a stipulated price of
rs.90 per sq.ft., which also is beyond the means of the slum and pavement-dwellers. the reigning market price of houses in bombay varies from rs.150 per sq.ft."
"thus, the reason why there are homeless people in
bombay is not that there is no land on which homes can be built for them but, that
the planning policy of the state government permits high density areas to develop
with vast tracts of land lying vacant. the pavement-dwellers and the slum-dwellers
who constitute 50% of the population of bombay, occupy only 25% of the city's
residential land. it is in these circumstances that out of sheer necessity for a bare
existence, the petitioners are driven to occupy the pavements and slums."

who constitute 50% of the population of bombay, occupy only 25% of the city's
residential land. it is in these circumstances that out of sheer necessity for a bare
existence, the petitioners are driven to occupy the pavements and slums. they live in
bombay because they are employed in bombay and they live on pavements because
there is no other place where they can live."
"apart from this, it is urged, the
restrictions which are sought to be imposed by the respondents on the use of
pavements by pavement-dwellers are not reasonable. a state which has failed in its
constitutional obligation to usher a socialistic society has no right to evict slum and
pavement-dwellers who constitute half of the city's population. therefore, sections
312,313 and 314 of the b.m.c."
"under
section 289(1) of the act, all pavements and public streets vest in the corporation
and are under the control of the commissioner. in so far as article 21 is concerned,
no deprivation of life, either directly or indirectly, is involved in the eviction of the
slum and pavement-dwellers from public places. the municipal corporation is under
an obligation under section 314 of the b.m.c."
"the petitions are clearly
maintainable under article 32 of the constitution. as we have stated while summing up the petitioners' case, the main plank of their argument is that
the right to life which is guaranteed by article 21 includes the right to livelihood and since, they will
be deprived of their livelihood if they are evicted from their slum and pavement dwellings, their
eviction is tantamount to deprivation of their life and is hence unconstitutional. for purposes ofolga tellis & ors vs bombay municipal corporation & ors."
"this decision is distinguishable
because, under the constitution, no person can claim the right to livelihood by the pursuit of an
opprobrious occupation or a nefarious trade or business, like tourism, gambling or living on the
gains of prostitution. the petitioners before us do not claim the right to dwell on pavements or in
slums for the purpose of pursuing any activity which is illegal, immoral or contrary to public
interest. many of them pursue occupations which are humble but honourable."
"many of them pursue occupations which are humble but honourable. turning to the factual situation, how far is it true to say that if the petitioners are evicted from their
slum and pavement dwellings, they will be deprived of their means of livelihood? it is impossible, in
the very nature of things, together reliable data on this subject in regard to each individual
petitioner and, none has been furnished to us in that form."
"it is impossible, in
the very nature of things, together reliable data on this subject in regard to each individual
petitioner and, none has been furnished to us in that form. that the eviction of a person from a
pavement or slum will inevitably lead to the deprivation of his means of livelihood, is a proposition
which does not have to be established in each individual case. that is an inference which can be
drawn from acceptable data."
"it is by that process that the
core of the problem can be reached and a satisfactory solution found. it would be unrealistic on our
part to reject the petitions on the ground that the petitioners have not adduced evidence to show
that they will be rendered jobless if they are evicted from the slums and pavements. commonsense,
which is a cluster of life's experiences, is often more dependable than the rival facts presented by
warring litigants."
"it is estimated that about 200 to 300 people enter bombay every
day in search of employment. these facts constitute empirical evidence to justify the conclusion that
persons in the position of petitioners live in slums and on pavements because they have small jobs
to nurse in the city and there is no where else to live. evidently, they choose a pavement or a slum in

"we have indicated
above that far from so intending, the legislature has left it to the discretion of the
commissioner whether or not to give notice, a discretion which has to be exercised
reasonably. counsel attempted to demonstrate the practical futility of issuing the
show cause notice by pointing out firstly, that the only answer which a pavement
dweller, for example, can make to such a notice is that he is compelled to live on the
pavement because he has no other place to go to and secondly, that it is hardly likely
that in pursuance of such a notice, pavement dwellers or slum dwellers would ask for
time to vacate since, on their own showing, they are compelled to occupy some
pavement or slum or the other if they are evicted. it may be true to say that, in the
generality of cases, persons who have committed encroachments on pavements or on
other public properties may not have an effective answer to give."
"it may be true to say that, in the
generality of cases, persons who have committed encroachments on pavements or on
other public properties may not have an effective answer to give. it is a notorious fact
of contemporary life in metropolitan cities, that no person in his senses would opt to
live on a pavement or in a slum, if any other choice were available to him. anyone
who cares to have even a fleeting glance at the pavement or slum dwellings will see
that they are the very hell on earth."

indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/709776/ 33the charge made by the state government in its affidavit that slum and pavement dwellers exhibit
especial criminal tendencies is unfounded. according to dr. p.k.muttagi, head of the unit for urban
studies of the tata institute of social sciences, bombay, the surveys carried out in T23 1977,1979
and 1981 show that many families which have chosen the bombay footpaths just for survival, have
been living there for several years and that 53 per cent of the pavement dwellers are self-employed
as hawkers in vegetables, flowers, ice-cream, toys, balloons, buttons, needles and so on."
"the same criterion would apply to the kamraj nagar basti as

T13 must be given alternate pitches at malavani though not as a condition precedent to the removal
of encroachments committed by them. secondly, slum dwellers who were censused and were given
identity cards must be provided with alternate accommodation before they are evicted. there is a

highest priority must be accorded by the state government to the resettlement of these unfortunate
persons by allotting to them such land as the government finds to be conveniently available."
"etc on 10 july, 1985
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/709776/ 35during the course of arguments, an affidavit was filed by shri s.k.jahagirdar, under secretary in
the department of housing, government of maharashtra, setting out the various housing schemes
which are under the consideration of the state government. the affidavit contains useful
information on various aspects relating to slum and pavement dwellers. the census of T13 which is
referred to in that affidavit shows that 28.18 lakhs of people were living in 6,27,404 households
spread over 1680 slum pockets."

spread over 1680 slum pockets. the earning of 80 per cent of the slum house holds did not exceed
rs.600 per month. the state government has a proposal to undertake 'low income scheme shelter
programme' with the aid of the world bank."
"under the scheme, 85,000 small plots for construction
of houses would become available, out of which 40,000 would be in greater bombay, 25,00 in the
thane-kalyan area and 20,000 in the new bombay region. the state government is also proposing
to undertake 'slum upgradation programme(sup)' under which basic civic amenities would be
made available to the slum dwellers. we trust that these schemes, grandiose as they appear, will be
pursued faithfully and the aid obtained from the world bank utilised systematically and effectively
for achieving its purpose."
"therefore, what is of crucial importance to the question of thinning out the squatters'
colonies in metropolitan cities is to create new opportunities for employment in the rural sector and
to spread the existing job opportunities evenly in urban areas. apart from the further misery and
degradation which it involves, eviction of slum and pavement dwellers is an ineffective remedy for
decongesting the cities. in a highly readable and moving account of the problems which the poor
have to face, susan george says: ('how the other half dies the real reasons for world hunger'
(polican books)."
"we have referred to the assurances given by the state
government in its pleadings here which, we repeat, must be made good. stated
briefly, pavement dwellers who were censused or who happened to be censused in
T13 should be given, though not as a condition precedent to their removal, alternate
pitches at malavani or at such other convenient place as the government considers
reasonable but not farther away in terms of distance; slum dwellers who were given
identity cards and whose dwellings were numbered in the T13 census must be given
alternate sites for their resettlement; slums which have been in existence for a long
time, say for T17 or more, and which have been improved and developed will
not be removed unless the land on which they stand or the appurtenant land, is
required for a public purposes, in which case, alternate sites or accommodation will
be provided to them, the 'low income scheme shelter programme' which is proposed
to be undertaken with the aid of the world bank will be pursued earnestly; and, the
slum upgradation programme (sup)' under which basic amenities are to be given to
slum dwellers will be implemented without delay. in order to minimise the hardship
involved in any eviction, we direct that the slums, wherever situated, will not be
removed until T18 after the end of the current monsoon season, that is, until
october 31,1985 and, thereafter, only in accordance with this judgment."
