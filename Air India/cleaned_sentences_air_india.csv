"respondent no. 1 (air
india) moved this court for transfer of the writ petition filed by the petitioners, nergesh
meerza & ors in the bombay high court to this court because the constitutional validity
of regulation 46(1)(c) of air india employees service regulations (hereinafter referred
to as 'a.i. regulations') and other questions of law were involved."
"regulations') and other questions of law were involved. another ground taken
by the applicant-air india in the transfer petition was that other writ petitions filed by
the air hostesses employed by the indian airlines corporation (hereinafter referred to
as ""i.a.c."") which were pending hearing in this court involved almost identical reliefs."
"for the purpose of brevity, the various petitions, orders, rules, etc. shall be referred to
as follows:

legal observer trust(1) air india as ""a.i."" (2) indian airlines corporation as ""i.a.c."""
"(2) indian airlines corporation as ""i.a.c."" (3) statutory regulations made under the air india corporation act of T28 or
the indian airlines corporation act of T28 would be referred to as 'a.i. regulation' and 'i.a.c."
"and air hostesses a 'ahs'. (10) air india cabin crew as 'a.i. crew' and indian airlines corporation cabin
crew as 'iac crew'
(11) flight steward as ""f.s."
"3. by virtue of section 3 of the T28 act, the central government by a notification
published in the official gazette created two corporations known as indian airlines and
air india international. section 3(2) provided that each of the two corporations would
be a body corporate having perpetual succession and a common seal subject to the
provisions of the act to acquire and hold property."
"in para 252 of the E16 the E13 regarding the E2 age is mentioned
thus:
252. at present, the E2 age of the air india employees is governed by
service, regulations nos. 46 and 47."
"on this point there can be no two opinions. it was
also pointed out that air hostesses do not stay very long in the service of air
india, and young and attractive women are more inclined to look upon service
in air india as a temporary occupation than as a career. most of them get
married and leave the service."
"in
this connection, the mahesh tribunal indicated the stand of the parties thus:
the aceu contends that age of E2 of air hostesses should be fixed at 45
instead of 30 or 35 as at present; that this demand for increase in the age of
E2 is in accordance with geneva convention and that the bar of
E3 on air hostesses should be removed. the air india's contention is that the nature and underlying object of the job of
an air hostess requires that their age of E2 should be kept at 30 as at
present. it has also been pointed out that after 30, the general manager of the
corporation has the discretion to extend the age of E2 of an air hostess
by one year at a time till she reaches the age of T17"
"it has also been pointed out that after 30, the general manager of the
corporation has the discretion to extend the age of E2 of an air hostess
by one year at a time till she reaches the age of T17 as for the E2
on E3 the air india's contention is that it is necessary and a desirable
provision as otherwise after E3 they will not be able to fulfil adequately
the main purpose of their employment. ."
". the rule regarding extension of service in the E15 between the aceu and
the indian airlines of january 10, T26 is better worded and it should be
adopted by the air india also in its entirety. 10."
"both the male
pursers and the ahs are members of the same cabin crew, performing identical
or similar duties and hence any discrimination made between these two
members who are similarly circumstanced is clearly violative of article 14 of the
constitution of india. (2) even if the ahs are a separate category or class, there is an inter se
discrimination between the ahs posted in the united kingdom and those
serving in the other air india flights. (3) that the ahs have been particularly selected for hostile discrimination by
the corporation mainly on the ground of sex or disabilities arising from sex and
therefore, the regulations amount to a clear infraction of the provisions of
article 15(1) and article 16 of the constitution of india."
"on the other
hand, assistant flight pursers who are recruited between the ages of 21 and 26
are entitled to E2 benefit of free air passage only if they voluntarily
retire after 25 years of continuous service or on attaining the age of
superannuation, i.e., T15 if the E2 age of air hostess were
extended to T15 they would be subjected to the same discipline and
reaction of many of the existing air hostesses in air india is that the
differentiation in E2 ages between men and women is fair and
reasonable and to their advantage. in fact most of the air hostesses are anxious
to complete 10 years of service and retire to become eligible for these benefits."
"these benefits are further explained in a chart given in ext. d which extracts the
relevant portions of air india employees passage regulations, T23 the relevant
portion of the provisions may be extracted thus:
category
scale of concession
period for which
concession would be
admissible
(a) employees retiring on
reaching the age of T15 or
55 years, as the case may be,
provided they have rendered
continuous service for a
minimum period of 20 years."
"on this point there can be no two
opinions. it was also pointed out that air hostesses do not stay very long in the
service of air india, and young and attractive women are more inclined to look
upon service in air india as a temporary occupation than as a career. most of
them get married and leave the service."
"similar demands were made before the mahesh tribunal which have been extracted
earlier. the observations of the mahesh tribunal may be extracted as follows:
there is no reason to have a different provision regarding the air hostesses in
air india. the social conditions in europe and elsewhere are different from the
social conditions in india."
"it seems, however, reasonable that the present practice of
restricting the extension beyond T19 to one year at a time need not be a
part of the rules. the rule regarding extension of service in the E15
between the aceu and the indian airlines of january 10, T26 is better worded
and it should be adopted by the air india also in its entirety. it enables the
general manager to give extension for periods longer than one year at a time, if
he considers it proper."
"in fact, as a very fair and
conscientious counsel mr. nariman realised the inherent weakness and the apparent
absurdity of the aforesaid E19 and in the course of his arguments he
stated that he had been able to persuade the management to amend the rules so as to
delete 'first pregnancy' as a ground for termination of the service and would see that
suitable amendments are made to regulation 46(i)(c) in the following manner:
(a) regulation 46(i)(c) will be amended so as to substitute for the words ""or a
first pregnancy"", the words ""or on a third pregnancy"". (b) there will be a suitably framed regulation to provide for the above and for
the following:
(i) an air hostess having reason to believe that she is pregnant will
intimate this to air india and will also elect in writing within a
reasonable time whether or not to continue in service. (ii) if such air hostess elects to continue in service on pregnancy, she
shall take leave from service for a period not later than that
commencing from 90 days after conception and will be entitled to
resume service only after E6 (or premature termination of
pregnancy) and after she is certified by the medical officer of air
india as being fit for resuming her duties as an air hostess after
delivery or E6 or prior termination of pregnancy."
"in fact, a similar grievance seems to have been
made before the mahesh tribunal which also pointed out that the social conditions in
europe and other countries being different, the same rules could not apply to a.i. in
this connection, the tribunal observed thus:
there is no reason to have a different provision regarding the air hostesses in
air india. the social conditions in europe and elsewhere are different from the
social conditions in india."
