"the absence of such a provision has entailed unspeak able misery to 
innumerable muslim women in british india. the hanaf i jurists

hanafi law causes hardship, it is permissible to appl y the provisions of 
the âmaliki, shafii or hambali lawâ. acting on this principle the ulemas have issued fatwa s to the effect that 
in cases enumerated in clause 3, part a of this bill (now see section 2 of 
the act), a married muslim woman may obtain a decree d issolving her 
marriage."
"the courts in british india have held in a number of cases 
that the apostasy of a married muslim woman ipso facto dissolves her 
marriage. this view has been repeatedly challenged at the bar, but the 
courts continue to stick to precedents created by rul ings based on an 
erroneous view of the muslim law. the ulemas have i ssued fatwas 
supporting non-dissolution of marriage by reason of wifeâs apostasy."

as such a view is contrary to all authority. a talak a ctually pronounced

muslim marriages and E9s registration act, 1935 i s voluntary, and 
unilateral. mere registration of E9 (or marriage ) even if proved, will 
not render valid E9 which is otherwise invalid under muslim law.â 
 
a perusal of the conclusion recorded by the high co urt, through the 
above observations, leaves no room for any doubt, t hat the âtalaq-e-biddatâ 
pronounced by the husband without reasonable cause,  and without being 
preceded by attempts of reconciliation, and without  the involvement of 
arbitrators with due representation on behalf of th e husband and wife, 54 would not lead to a valid E9. the high court also concluded, that the 
petitioner â jiauddin ahmed, had mainly alleged tha t he had pronounced 
talaq, but had not established the factum of divorc e by adducing any 
cogent evidence."
"the first point to be decided, therefore, is whether  the opposite party 
divorced the petitioner. the equivalent of the word 'div orce' is 'talaq' in 
muslim law. what is valid 'talaq' in muslim law was c onsidered by one of 
us (baharul islam, j. as he then was) sitting singly i n criminal revision 
no."
"in the case of ahmed kasim molla v. khatun bibi repor ted in ilr cal 
833, which has so long been regarded as a leading c ase on the law of 
E9 justice costello held: 
âupon that point (E9), there are a number of author ities and i have 
carefully considered this point as dealt with in the very early authorities 
to see whether i am in agreement with the mere recent dec isions of the 
courts. i regret that i have to come to the conclusion tha t at the law 
stands at present, any mohamedan may E9 his wife at his mere 
whim and caprice.â 56 following macnaghten, j. who held: ""there is no occasi on for any 
particular cause for E9 and mere whim is suffi cient,'' and batchelor, 
j, in case of sarabai v. babiabai (ilr 30 bombay 53 7) costello, j. held:â 
âit is good in law, though bad in theology.â 
ameer ali, in his treatise on mahomedan law has obse rved: 
âthe prophet pronounced talaq to be a most destable thing  before the 
almighty god of all permitted things. if 'talaq' is given without any reason it is stupidity  and ingratitude to 
god.â 
the learned author in the same book has also observed  
âthe author of the multeka (ibrohim halebi) is more c oncise."
"in ilr 30 madras 22  precisely held 
was that impropriety of the husband's conduct would in no way affect 
the legal validity of a E9 duly effected by the h usband. the emphasis 
was that a talaq would be valid only if it is effecte d in accordance with 
the muslim law. in ilr 5, rangoon 18, their lordships of the privy co uncil observed: 
âaccording to that law (the muslim law), a husband ca n effect a E9 
whenever he desires.â 
but the privy council has not said that the E9 need  not be duly 
effected or that procedure enjoined by the quran need  not be followed."

but the privy council has not said that the E9 need  not be duly 
effected or that procedure enjoined by the quran need  not be followed. 8."
"8. it is needless to say that holy quran is the primary  source and is the 
weightiest authority on any subject under the muslim law . the single 
judge in criminal revision no."
"p. 32. it seems that modern indian hanafi scholars have ta ken this opinion as well: the compendium of islamic  
laws, 2001, part ii, section 24, states the followi ng: âif a person pronouncing talaq says that he int ended 
only a single talaq and repeated the words of talaq  only to put emphasis and these words were not mean t 
to pronounce more than one talaq, his statement on oath will be acceptedâ . translated by mahmood."
"translated by mahmood. (also see: the muslim law of india, 3rd ed., tahir mahmood, lexis nexis butterworths: new delhi 
(2002),p.107, where the learned author noted: âin i ndia there has been no legislation in this regard, but 
the muftis of the time now agree that if a man pron ounces the so-called 'triple talaq' but later swear s that 
he did not mean it, his declaration may be given th e effect of a single talaq revocable during iddat a nd, if 
not so revoked, leaving room for a fresh nikah ther eafter with the wife's consent â). such a view is, 
perhaps, based upon an application of the following  legal maxim of islamic law - al-umuru bi-
maqasidiha: acts are judged by the intention behind  them."
"finally, many muslim countries, 
including algeria, egypt, jordan, morocco, sudan, s yria, and yemen, have implemented laws that 
uphold the notion that a triple talak counts as onl y one talak. personal law in islamic countries, tah ir

6 see supra, fn 25 & 26, for the opinion of the hanaf i madhab that E8 is sinful."
"the high co urt therefore, embarked 
on the exercise of examining the validity of âtalaq-e -biddatâ. (iii) the consideration :  the high court took into consideration texts by 
renowned scholars, as for instance, from âshariaâ by  wael b. hallaq, 
âsharia law, an introductionâ by mohammad hashim kama li, âqurâan: the 
living truthâ by basheer ahmad mohyidin, âmuslim law  in india and 
abroadâ by dr. tahir mahmood, âthe lawful and the p rohibited in islamâ by 
sheikh yusuf al-qaradawi, from the urdu book âhikma tul islamâ by 
moulana wahidul khan. the high court also took into consideration 
quranic verses (all of which have been, extracted ab ove)."
"but rather it require a state 
intervention by way of legislation to regulate triple ta laq in india. therefore, settlement of law relating to talaq is necessa ry and further 
discussion is to be treated as an allude for the state to consider for 
possible reforms of E9 law of muslim in this c ountry . the empirical 
research placed herein justifies such course of acti on to remind the state 
for action."
"justice has become elusive 
for muslim women in india not because of the religion  they profess, but 
on account of lack of legal formalism resulting in im munity from law . law required to be aligned with justice. the search f or solution to this 
predicament lies in the hands of the law makers."

ministry and law commission of india.â 67 a perusal of the conclusions drawn by the high court r eveals, that the 
practice of âtalaq-e-biddatâ, was deprecated by the cou rt. the court 
however called upon the legislature, to codify the law  on the issue, as would 
result in the advancement of justice, as a matter of in stitutional form."
"i t was commended, 
that the instant practice of âtalaq-e-biddatâ should be d one away with, in the 
same manner as the practice of âsatiâ, âdevadasiâ and  âpolygamyâ, which were 
components of hindu religion, and faith. learned cou nsel concluded his 
submissions by quoting from the constitutional law of india, by h.m. 
seervai (fourth edition, volume 2, published by n.m. tripathi private ltd., 
bombay), wherein in clause 12.60, at page 1281, the author has expressed

was submitted, that they were therefore far less credib le and authentic, and 
also distorted and unreliable, as against the âhadiths â taken into 
consideration in the judgments rendered by the high co urts (-for details, 
                                                 
14  (2014) 4 scc 1 77 refer to part-6 â judicial pronouncements, on the sub ject of âtalaq-e-
biddatâ)."
"it was submitted, 
that on personal issues, muslims were governed by the muslim âpersonal 
lawâ â shariat. it was contended, that even before, the commencement of the 
constitution, the muslim personal law (shariat) appl ication act, 1937 
enforced muslim âpersonal lawâ, and as such, the mus lim âpersonal lawâ 
should be considered as a âlaw in forceâ, within the meaning of article 
13(3)(b). it was pointed out, that the instant position made the legal 
position separate and distinct from what ordinarily fa lls in the realm of 
âpersonal lawâ."
"dr. rajan chandra and mr. arif mohd. khan, advo cates, appeared 
on behalf of the muslim women personal law board. i t was their 96 contention, that it has been acknowledged by all concer ned, including the 
aimplb, that âtalaq-e-biddatâ was derogatory to the dig nity of women, and 
that, it breaches the concept of gender equality."
"to construe law one must enter 
into its spirit, its setting and history. law should be c apable to expand 
freedom of the people and the legal order can weigh w ith utmost equal 
care to provide the underpinning of the highly inequita ble social order. judicial review must be exercised with insight into social values to 
supplement the changing social needs."
"article 13 reads as 
under:  
â13. laws inconsistent with or in derogation of the fu ndamental rights.- 
(1) all laws in force in the territory of india imme diately before the 
commencement of this constitution, in so far as they ar e inconsistent 
with the provisions of this part, shall, to the extent of  such 
inconsistency, be void. (2) the state shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the 
rights conferred by this part and any law made in con travention of this 
clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void ."
"(2) if the 
phrase just quoted was intended to have such a wide op eration as 
cutting at even the essentials guaranteed by article 25(1 ), there would 
have been no need for the special provision as to ât hrowing open of 
hindu religious institutionsâ to all classes and secti ons of hindus since 
the legislation contemplated by this provision would be par excellence 
one of social reform.â 
 
73. it was pointed out, that in the counter-affidavit dated august 2016, 
filed on behalf of the muslim personal law board, i. e., respondent no.3 to 
this petition, the practices of E8 (as well as, ânikah halalaâ and 
polygamy) have been referred to as âundesirableâ. i t was accordingly 
                                                 
28  air 1962 sc 853 120 submitted, that no âundesirableâ practice can be conferr ed the status of an 
âessential practiceâ, much less one that forms the subs tratum of the 
concerned religion."
"in morocco and indonesia, 
E9 proceedings take place in a secular court, pr ocedures of mediation 
and reconciliation are encouraged, and men and women  are considered 
equal in matters of family and E9. in indonesia , E9 is a judicial 
process, where those marrying under islamic law, ca n approach the 
religious court for a E9, while others can appro ach district courts for 
the same. in iran and sri lanka, E9 can be gra nted by a qazi and/or a 
court, only after reconciliation efforts have failed."
"it was pointed out, that the personal affairs referre d to in the 
foregoing paragraph, fall in the realm of âpersonal lawâ. this assertion, was 
sought to be demonstrated, by placing reliance on the d efinition of the term 
âpersonal lawâ in blacks law dictionary (10th  edition, 2014), as follows: 
âthe law that governs a personâs family matters, regard less of where the 
person goes . in common law systems, personal law refers to the l aw of 
the personâs domicile."
"in common law systems, personal law refers to the l aw of 
the personâs domicile. in civil-law systems, it refer s to the law of the 
individualâs nationality (and so is sometimes called  lex patriae).â 
reference was also made to the definition of the term âpersonal lawâ in 
âconflict of laws 188â (7 th  edition, 1974) by r.h. graveson, who defined the 
term as under: 
âthe idea of the personal law is based on the concept ion of man as a 
social being, so that those transactions of his daily l ife which affect him 
most closely in a personal sense, such as marriage, E9 legitimacy, 
many kinds of capacity, and succession, may be gove rned universally by 
that system of law deemed most suitable and adequate fo r the purpose  
â¦â 
based on the cumulative definition of the term âpersona l lawâ, it was 
submitted, that the evolution of the matters of faith relati ng to religious 
practices, must necessarily be judged in the context of practices adopted by 
the concerned community, with reference to each indiv idual aspect of 
âpersonal lawâ. it was conceded, on behalf of the a implb, that âpersonal 
lawsâ were per se  subservient to legislation, and as such, âpersonal la wsâ 
were liable to be considered as mandatory, with refer ence to numerous 
aspects of an individualâs life, only in the absence  of legislation."
"section 112, 
aforementioned is extracted hereunder: 
â112. law to be administered in cases of inheritance a nd succession. â 
the high courts at calcutta, madras and bombay, in the  exercise of their 
original jurisdiction in suits against inhabitants of calcutta, madras or 
bombay, as the case may be, shall, in maters of inher itance and 
succession to lands, rents and goods, and in matters o f contract and 
dealing between party and party, when both parties ar e subject to the 
same personal law or custom having the force of law,  decide according to 
that personal law or custom, and when the parties are su bject to 
different personal laws or customs having  the force  of law, decide 
according to the law or custom to which the defendant is  subject .â 
it was pointed out, that in framing article 13, the choice  of the words 
âcustom and usageâ and the exclusion of the expressio n âpersonal lawâ 
needed to be taken due note of."
"what have these things got to  do with religion 
i really fail to understand. take for instance the hindu law draft which 
is before the legislative assembly. if one looks at ma nu and 
yagnyavalkya and all the rest of them, i think most of the provisions of 
the new bill will run counter to their injunctions."
"but you  have already passed 
a fundamental right to that effect and you have an artic le here which 
lays down that there should be no discrimination aga inst sex. look at 
hindu law; you get any amount of discrimination agains t women; and if 
that is part of hindu religion or hindu religious prac tice, you cannot 
pass a single law which would elevate the position o f hindu women to  
that of men. therefore, there is no reason why there s hould not be a civil 
code throughout the territory of india ."
"after all the only community that is willing to adapt  
itself to changing times seems to be the majority commun ity in the 
country. they are willing to take lessons from the min ority and adapt 
their hindu laws and take a leaf from the muslims for the purpose of 
reforming even the hindu law. therefore, there is no force to the 
objection that is put forward to article 35 ."
"the future legislatures may 
attempt a uniform civil code or they may not. the unifo rm civil code 
will run into every aspect of civil law. in regard to  contracts, procedure 
and property uniformity is sought to be secured by th eir finding a place 
in the concurrent list."
"we have a uniform and complete c riminal code 
operating throughout the country, which is contained in th e penal code 
and the criminal procedure code. we have the law of transfer of 
property, which deals with property relations and wh ich is operative 
throughout the country. then there are the negotiable ins truments acts: 
and i can cite innumerable enactments which would prov e that this  
country has practically a civil code, uniform in its c ontent and 
applicable to the whole of the country."
"then there are the negotiable ins truments acts: 
and i can cite innumerable enactments which would prov e that this  
country has practically a civil code, uniform in its c ontent and 
applicable to the whole of the country. the only provi nce the civil law 
has not been able to invade so far is marriage and su ccession. it is this 150 little corner which we have not been able to invade so  far and it is the 
intention of those who desire to have article 35 as part of the 
constitution to bring about that change."
"my first observation would be to sta te that members 
who put forth these amendments say that the muslim persona l law, so 
far as this country was concerned, was immutable and u niform through 
the whole of india. now i wish to challenge that statemen t. i think most 
of my friends who have spoken on this amendment have quite forgotten 
that up to 1935 the north-west frontier province was not subject to the 
shariat law. it followed the hindu law in the matter of  succession and 
in other matters, so much so that it was in 1939 that the central 
legislature had to come into the field and to abrogate t he application of 
the hindu law to the muslims of the north-west frontier p rovince and 
to apply the shariat law to them."

"that is not all. my honourable friends have forgotten, that, apart from the north-west 
frontier province, up till 1937 in the rest of india, in various parts, such 
as the united provinces, the central provinces and bomb ay, the muslims 
to a large extent were governed by the hindu law in th e matter of 
succession. in order to bring them on the plane of u niformity with regard 
to the other muslims who observed the shariat law, the legislature had 
to intervene in 1937 and to pass an enactment applying the shariat law

the marumakkathyam law."
"reference is only necessary to the statemen ts made by h.m. 
abdullah and abdul qaiyum on the floor of the house . the same are 
extracted hereunder: 
âmr h. m. abdullah (west central punjab: muhammadan):  sir, i beg to 
move: ""that the bill to make provision for the applic ation of the moslem 
personal law (shariat) to moslems in british india, as reported by the 
select committee, be taken into consideration."" the object of the bill, as the house is already aware,  is to replace the 
customary law by the shari at law in certain matters whe re the parties to 
a dispute are muslims."
"sir, i move. mr deputy president (mr akhil chandra dattas): motion m oved: ""that 
the bill to make provision for the application of the moslem personal law 
(shariat) to moslems in british india, as reported b y the select 
committee, be taken into consideration."" mr abdul qaiyum (north-west frontier province: genera l): sir, i am in 
sympathy with the objects which this very useful bill  aims at."
"a representative body of muslim ulema like the jamait- ululemai-hind 
has also expressed its sympathy with the objects of this  bill. sir, there is 
something in the word shariat, -may be it is arabic, -  which gives a sort 
of fright to some of my honourable friends, but i thin k if they try to read 
the muhammadan law on the point, especially on the poi nt of 
succession, they will realise that this bill was long overdue and that it is 
a step in the right direction. people have no idea of w hat terrible 
conditions the muslim women have had to endure in my own province : i 
can say that whenever a muslim died, at least before th e frontier shariat 
law was enacted in the north-west frontier province, h is daughter, his 
sister and his wife all used to be thrown into the stree t, and the 
reversioner in the tenth degree would come round and collar all his 
property."

people realise that this bill is primarily intended to i mprove the status of 
women and to confer upon them benefits which are lawfu lly their due 
under the muhammadan law, then they will gladly suppor t this measure ."
"if it is so extended, it would 
mean that the people of the frontier province would be ta king a step 
backward and not forwards. it is well-known fact and it is laid down in 
the government of india act, section 107, that where a fe deral law 
comes into conflict with a provincial law and even if  the federal law has 
been passed after the provincial law, then to that ext ent it over-rides the 
provincial law and the provincial law becomes null a nd void. therefore, 
my submission is that the intention with which i tabled m y amendment 
was not with any idea of opposing the object of this bi ll, but my reason 
for moving this amendment is that this bill does not go as far as we wish 
to go -at least in one province, namely, the north-west f rontier province."
"it was submitted, that the above enactment did not decide what 
was, or was not, muslim âpersonal lawâ â âshariatâ. it would therefore be a 
misnomer to consider that the muslim personal law (shar iat) application 
act, 1937, in any way, legislated on the above subject. it was pointed out, 
that muslim âpersonal lawâ â âshariatâ comprised of the  declarations 
contained in the quran, or through âhadithsâ, âijmasâ  and âqiyasâ (-for details, 
refer to part-2 â the practiced modes of âtalaqâ among st muslims)."
"the 
aforesaid affidavit was duly filed, which reads as u nder: 160 â1. i am the secretary of all india muslim personal  law board which has 
been arraigned as respondent no.3 and as respondent n o.8 respectively 
to the above-captioned writ petitions. i am conversant wi th the facts 
and circumstances of the present case and i am compete nt to swear this 
affidavit."
"2. i say and submit that the all india muslim personal law board will 
issue an advisory through its website, publications an d social media 
platforms and thereby advise the persons who perform ânikahâ (marriage) 
and request them to do the following:-  
(a) at the time of performing ânikahâ (marriage), the person performing 
the ânikahâ will advise the bridegroom/man that in cas e of differences 
leading to talaq the bridegroom/man shall not pronounc e three divorces 
in one sitting since it is an undesirable practice in s hariat;  
(b) that at the time of performing ânikahâ (marriage) , the person 
performing the ânikahâ will advise both the bridegroo m/man and the 
bride/woman to incorporate a condition in the ânikahnam aâ to exclude 
resorting to pronouncement of three divorces by her hu sband in one 
sitting . 3."
"it was submitted that this court considered the followin g issues 
during the course of adjudication of the above matter . â(i) whether muslim personal law which allows polyga my is void as 
offending articles 14 and 15 of the constitution. (ii) whether muslim personal law which enables a mus lim male to give 
unilateral talaq to his wife without her consent and wit hout resort to 
judicial process of courts, is void as it offends arti cles 13, 14 and 15 of 
the constitution."

wife is an act of cruelty.â 
 
103."
"it would be relevant to mention, at the outset, that l earned senior 
counsel endorsed the submissions advanced by mr. kap il sibal and mr. 
raju ramachandra, senior advocates, who had assisted this court before 
him. learned senior counsel focused his contentions,  firstly to the 
challenge raised to the validity of section 2 of the muslim personal law 
(shariat) application act, 1937, insofar as, it relate s to âtalaq-e-biddatâ on 
the ground, that the same being unconstitutional, was unenforceable. learned senior counsel, in order to raise his challe nge, first and foremost, 
drew our attention to sections 2 and 3 of the muslim pers onal law  (shariat) 
application act, 1937 (-for details, refer to part-4 â  legislation in india, in 
the field of muslim âpersonal lawâ)."
"learned senior counsel focused his contentions,  firstly to the

application act, 1937 (-for details, refer to part-4 â  legislation in india, in 
the field of muslim âpersonal lawâ). it was submitted , that section 2 
aforesaid, commenced with a non obstante  clause."
"it was submitted, that the 1937 legisla tion was only 
statutorily declared that the muslim âpersonal lawâ, as a set of rules, would 
govern the muslims in india, and that, it would be the muslim âpersonal lawâ 
that would have an overriding effect over any custom or usage to the 
contrary. it was therefore reiterated, that the legisla ture which enacted the 
muslim personal law (shariat) application act, 1937, neither modified nor 
amended even in a small measure, the muslim âpersona l lawâ applicable to 
the muslims in india, nor did the legislature while e nacting the above 
enactment, subsumed the muslim âpersonal lawâ, and the refore, the 
character of the muslim âpersonal lawâ did not undergo  a change on account 
of the enactment of the muslim personal law (shariat) ap plication act, 
1937. according to learned senior counsel, the musl im âpersonal lawâ did 
not metamorphized into a statute, and as such, the rights  and duties of 
muslims in india continued to be governed even after  the enactment of the 
shariat act, as before."
"as such, it was contended, that it was  wholly unjustified to 
assume, that muslim âpersonal lawâ â âshariatâ was giv en statutory effect, 
through the shariat act. it was therefore submitted that a challenge to the 
validity of section 2 of the above enactment, so as to assail the validity of 174 âtalaq-e-biddatâ as being contrary to the fundamental rig hts contained in 
part iii of the constitution, was an exercise in futilit y.  insofar as the 
instant assertion is concerned, learned senior counsel  advanced two 
submissions â firstly, that section 2 of the muslim pers onal law (shariat) 
application act, 1937 did not by itself bring about an y law providing for 
rights and obligations to be asserted and discharged by the muslims as a 
community, for the simple reason, that it only reaff irmed the perpetuieties 
of the muslim âpersonal lawâ â âshariatâ, and as such , the rights and 
obligations of persons which were subjected to musli m âpersonal lawâ â 
âshariatâ, continued as they existed prior to the enactm ent of the shariat 
act. and secondly, the muslim âpersonal lawâ â âsh ariatâ, was neither 
transformed nor metamorphized by the shariat act, in the nature of 
crystalised rules and regulations, and as such, even if section 2 of the 
muslim personal law (shariat) application act, 1937 wa s struck down, the 
same would automatically revive the muslim âpersonal lawâ â âshariatâ, in 
view of the mandate contained in article 25 of the cons titution."
"it was therefore submitted that a challenge to the

same would automatically revive the muslim âpersonal lawâ â âshariatâ, in 
view of the mandate contained in article 25 of the cons titution. accordingly, it was pointed out, that the parameters of c hallenge, as were 
applicable to assail a statutory enactment, would not be  applicable in the 
matter of assailing the muslim âpersonal lawâ â âshar iatâ."
"we will need  to determine, the legal 
sanctity of âtalaq-e-biddatâ â E8 this will  enable us to ascertain, 
whether the practice of talaq has a legislative sanction,  because it is the 
petitionerâs case, that it is so through express legislati on (-the muslim 
personal law (shariat) application act, 1937). but the stance adopted on 
behalf of those contesting the petitionerâs claim is, tha t its stature is that of 
âpersonal lawâ, and on that account, the practice of â talaq-e-biddatâ has a 
constitutional protection."
"the judgment in the rashid ahmad case 1 was rendered in 1932. the 179 asserted statutory status of muslim âpersonal lawâ (as h as been canvassed 
by the petitioners), emerged from the enactment of the mus lim personal law 
(shariat) application act, 1937. the âshariatâ act ex pressly provided, that 
the muslim âpersonal lawâ â âshariatâ, would constitu te âthe rule of decisionâ, 
in causes where the parties were muslim."
"117. if the muslim personal law (shariat) application act, 1937, had 
incorporated the manner in which questions regarding i ntestate succession, 
special property of females including personal prop erty inherited or 180 obtained under contract or gift or matters such as marria ge, dissolution of 
marriage, including talaq, ila, jihar, lian, E3 a nd E4 
maintenance, dower, guardianship, gifts, trusts and tr ust properties, and 
wakfs (-as in section 2 thereof), had to be dealt with, as per muslim 
âpersonal lawâ â âshariatâ according to the petitioner s, it would be quite a 
different matter. all the same, the shariat act did not describe how the 
above questions and subjects had to be dealt with."
"without pointedly examining the issue of the validi ty of âtalaq-e-
biddatâ, under the muslim âpersonal lawâ â âshariatâ,  this court in fuzlunbi 
v. k. khader vali36 , recorded the following observations: 
â20. before we bid farewell to fazlunbi it is necessa ry to mention that 
chief justice baharul islam, in an elaborate judgmen t replete with 
quotes from the holy quoran, has exposed the error of early english 
authors and judges who dealt with talaq in muslim law as good even if 
pronounced at whim or in tantrum, and argued against the  diehard view 
                                                 
36  (1980) 4 scc 125 182 of batchelor j. ilr 30 bom 539 that this view âis goo d in law, though bad 
in theologyâ . maybe, when the point directly arises, the question will 
have to be considered by this court, but enough unto the  day the evil 
thereof and we do not express our opinion on this ques tion as it does not 
call for a decision in the present case .â 
 
the above observations lead to the inference, that the pr oposition of law 
pronounced by the privy council in the rashid ahmad c ase 1, needed a 
relook."
"to repudiate the 
veracity of the âhadithsâ relied upon by the responde nts, it was pointed out, 
that it was by now settled, that there were various degrees  of reliability 
and/or authenticity of different âhadithsâ. referring  to the principles of 
mohomedan law by sir dinshaw fardunji mulla (lexisn exis, butterworths 
wadhwa, nagpur, 20 th  edition), it was asserted, that the âhadithsâ relied 192 upon by the aimplb (to which a reference will be mad e separately), were far 
â far removed from the time of the prophet mohammad. i t was explained, 
that âhadithsâ recorded later in point of time, were les s credible and 
authentic,  as with the passage of time, distortions wer e likely to set in, 
making them unreliable."
"it is 
submitted that he belonged to 
the ahl-e-hadith/salafi school, 
which school does not recognize 
E8 (iii) dr. tahir mahmood 
(referred in para 6 of the

"(iii) dr. tahir mahmood 
(referred in para 6 of the 
judgment) he was a professor of law, delhi 
university. he wrote a book entitled âmuslim 
law in india and abroadâ and 
other books. referred to other 
islamic scholars to state, that it 
is a misconception that three 
talaqs have to be pronounced in 
three consecutive months, it is 
not a general rule as the three 
pronouncements have to be 
made when the wife is not in her 
menses, which would obviously 
require about three months."
"reference to tafs ir ibn kathir was 
stated to be improper, as he belonged to the ahl-e-hadit h/salafi school, 198 which school does not accept E8 it was subm itted, that dr. tahir 
mahmood was a professor of law at the delhi universit y, and his views 
must be treated as personal to him, and could not be elevated to the 
position of âhadithsâ. it was pointed out, that sheikh yu suf al-qaradawi, 
was a follower of ahl-e-hadith school, and therefor e, his views could not be 
taken into consideration."
"abu ameenah bilal 
philips, it was submitted, that he was also a follower  of the ahl-e-
hadith/salafi school. last of all, with reference to mohammed hashim 
kamali, it was pointed out, that he was merely a profess or of law, and the 
views expressed by him should be considered as his personal views. it was 
accordingly asserted, that supplanting the views of othe r schools of sunni 
muslims, with reference to the practice of âtalaq-e-bid datâ by the proponents 
of the hanafi school, and even with the beliefs of sh ia muslims, was a clear 
breach of a rightful understanding of the school, an d the practice in 
question."
"we are of the view, that the practice  of âtalaq-e-biddatâ, 
has had the sanction and approval of the religious den omination which 
practiced it, and as such, there can be no doubt that the practice, is a part 
of their âpersonal lawâ. v.  did the muslim personal law (shariat) application  act, 1937 confer  
statutory status to the subjects regulated by the said le gislation ? 146."
"147. the contention now being dealt with, was raised wi th the object of 
demonstrating, that after the enactment of the muslim per sonal law 
(shariat) application act, 1937, the questions and subj ects covered by the 
shariat act, ceased to be âpersonal lawâ, and got trans formed into âstatutory 
lawâ. it is in this context, that it was submitted, by ms. indira jaising, 
learned senior counsel and some others, that the tag of âpersonal lawâ got 
removed from the muslim âpersonal lawâ â âshariatâ, after the enactment of 
the shariat act, at least for the questions/subjects with reference to which 
the legislation was enacted."
"we have already enumerated the relevant provisio ns of the shariat 
act (-for details, refer to part-4 â legislation in in dia, in the field of muslim 
âpersonal lawâ). a perusal of section 2 thereof (ex tracted in paragraph 23 
above) reveals, that on the questions/subjects of intesta te succession, 
special property of females, including personal pro perty inherited or 
obtained under contract or gift or any other provision of âpersonal lawâ, 
marriage, E2 including talaq, ila, zihar, lian, E3 and 
E4 maintenance, dower, guardianship, gifts, trus ts and trust 
properties, and wakfs, ââ¦ the rule of decision â¦â, wh ere the parties are 
muslims, shall be ââ¦ the muslim personal law â shar iat. the submission 
of the learned counsel representing the petitioners, in  support of the instant 
contention was, that since the ârule of the decisionâ inter alia  with reference 
to âtalaqâ (-âtalaq-e-biddatâ), was thereafter to be reg ulated in terms of the 
shariat act, what was âpersonal lawâ (-prior to the abo ve enactment), came 
to be transformed into âstatutory lawâ."
"209 152. mr. kapil sibal, learned senior counsel appear ing for the aimplb, 
drew our attention to the debates in the legislative asse mbly, whereupon, 
the muslim personal law (shariat) application act, 193 7 was enacted (for 
details, refer to paragraph 94). having invited our a ttention to the above 
debates and more particularly to the statements of abdu l qaiyum 
(representing north-west frontier province), it was con tended, that the 
legislation under reference, was not enacted with the o bject of giving a 
statutory status to the muslim âpersonal lawâ â âshariat â."
"153. mr. v. giri, learned senior counsel, supported the above contention 
by placing reliance on section 2 of the muslim person al law (shariat) 
application act, 1937, on  behalf of the aimplb. it w as asserted, that 210 section 2 has a non obstante  clause."
"learned senior counsel for the respondents desir ed us to accept 
their point of view, for yet another reason. it was su bmitted, that the 
muslim personal law (shariat) application act, 1937, d id not decide what 
was, and what was not, muslim âpersonal lawâ â âshari atâ. it was therefore 
pointed out, that it would be a misnomer to consider, tha t the shariat act, 
legislated in the field of muslim âpersonal lawâ â â shariatâ  in any manner on 
muslim âpersonal lawâ â âshariatâ."
"it was therefore contended, that the m uslim âpersonal lawâ 
â âshariatâ was never metamorphosed  into a statute. it was therefore 
contended, that it would be wholly improper to assume tha t muslim 
âpersonal lawâ â âshariatâ was given statutory effect , through the muslim 
personal law (shariat) application act, 1937. 155."
"155. based on the above contentions, it was submitted, tha t the muslim 
personal law (shariat) application act, 1937 cannot be  treated as having 
conferred statutory status on the muslim âpersonal lawâ  â âshariatâ, and as 
such, the same cannot be treated as a statutory enactme nt, so as to be 
tested for its validity in the manner contemplated und er article 13(1) of the 
constitution. 156."
"we have given our thoughtful consideration to the  submissions 
advanced at the hands of learned counsel for the rival  parties. having 
closely examined section 2 of the muslim personal law  (shariat) application 
act, 1937, we are of the view, that the limited purpose o f the aforesaid 
provision was to negate the overriding effect of usag es and customs over the 
muslim âpersonal lawâ â âshariatâ. this determinati on of ours clearly 
emerges even from the debates in the legislative assem bly before the 
enactment of muslim personal law (shariat) applicatio n act, 1937."

the statements of h.m. abdullah (representing west centra l punjab) and 
abdul qaiyum (representing north-west frontier province ), leave no room 212 for any doubt, that the objective sought to be achieved  by the âshariatâ was 
inter alia  to negate the overriding effect on customs and usage s over the 
muslim âpersonal lawâ â âshariatâ."
"the 1939 
act would form a part of âstatutory lawâ, and not âper sonal lawâ. we are 
therefore constrained to accept the contention advanced by  learned counsel 
for the respondents, that the proposition canvassed on b ehalf of the 
petitioners, namely, that the muslim personal law (shar iat) application act, 
1937 conferred statutory status, on the questions/subje cts governed by the 
shariat act, cannot be accepted. that being the positio n, muslim âpersonal 
lawâ â âshariatâ cannot be considered as a state enactm ent."
"157. in view of the conclusions recorded in the fore going paragraph, it is 
not possible for us to accept, the contention advanced o n behalf of the 
petitioners, that the questions/subjects covered by the mus lim personal 
law (shariat) application act, 1937 ceased to be âper sonal lawâ and got 
transformed into âstatutory lawâ. having concluded as above, we must also 
hold (-which we do), that the practices of muslim âpers onal lawâ â âshariatâ 
cannot be required to satisfy the provisions contained in part iii â 
fundamental rights, of the constitution, applicable to s tate actions, in 
terms of article 13 of the constitution."
"158. in our consideration recorded hereinabove, we h ave held, that the 
provisions of the muslim personal law (shariat) appl ication act, 1937 did 
not alter the âpersonal lawâ status of the muslim âperso nal lawâ â âshariatâ. we shall now deal with the next step."

"even ar ticle 21 is a protection

"the statement of objects and reasons of t he foreign marriage

âstatement of objects and reasons

governed by principles of private international law w hich are by no 
means well-settled, and which cannot readily be applie d to a country 
such as ours in which different marriage laws apply to different 
communities."
"for their personal relations, they follow the muslim âpersonal

as already noticed above provided, âthe rule of deci sionâ in matters

ila, zihar, lian, E3 and E4 would be the mus lim âpersonal lawâ â

finally culminating in shamim ara  by this court which has since 
                                                 
50  verses from the holy quran as extracted above are taken from âthe holy qurâanâ 
translated by abdullah yusuf ali which was agreed t o be a fair translation by all parties. 51 similar observations were made by the high court of  gauhati through baharul islam, j. in 
jiauddin ahmed v. anwara begum (1981) 1 gau lr 358 wherein he noted that âthough 
marriage under muslim law is only a civil contract yet the rights and responsibilities 
consequent upon it are of such importance to the we lfare of humanity, that a high degree 
of sanctity is attached to it. but in spite of the sacredness of the character of the marriage-
tie, islam recognizes the necessity, in exceptional  circumstances, of keeping the way open 
for its dissolution â."
"to quote: 
 
â20. before we bid farewell to fuzlunbi  it is 
necessary to mention that chief justice baharul 
islam, in an elaborate judgment replete with 
quotes from the holy quoran, has exposed the 
error of early english authors and judges who 
dealt with talaq  in muslim law as good even if 
pronounced at whim or in tantrum, and argued 
against the diehard view of batchelor, j. that this  
view âis good in law, though bad in theologyâ. maybe, when the point directly arises, the 
question will have to be considered by this court 
but enough unto the day the evil thereof and we 
do not express our opinion on this question as it

"in a. s. parveen akthar  v. the union of india 60 , the 
high court of madras was posed with the question on  the 
validity and constitutionality of section 2 of the 1937 act in so 
far as it recognises E8 as a valid form o f E9 the 
court referred to the provisions of the quran, opin ions of 
various eminent scholars of islamic law and previou s judicial 
pronouncements including shamim ara  and came to the 
following conclusion:  
 
â45.thus, the law with regard to talaq, as declared  
by the apex court, is that talaq must be for a 
reasonable cause and must be preceded by 
attempt at reconciliation between the husband 
and the wife by two arbiters one chosen by wife's 
family and the other from husband's family and it 
is only if their attempts fail, talaq may be effect ed. xxxx 
48.having regard to the law now declared by the 
apex court in the case of shamim ara , 2002 air 
scw 4162, talaq, in whatever form, must be for a 
reasonable cause, and must be preceded by 
attempts for reconciliation by arbiters chosen

60  2003-1-l.w."
"the only thing to be further considered in this 
case is whether the E9 alleged to have been 
effected by the husband by pronouncement of 
talaq on 23-7-1999 is proved or not. the mere 
pronouncement of talaq three times even in the 
presence of the wife is not sufficient to effect a 
E9 under mohammadan law. as held by the 
supreme court in shamim ara's  case [2002 (3) klt 
537 (sc)], there should be an attempt of mediation 
by two mediators; one on the side of the husband 
and the other on the side of the wife and only in 
case it was a failure that the husband is entitled to 
pronounce talaq to E9 the wifeâ¦ â

"to this , the 
counter argument of the other side is that muslim 305 personal laws are not being attacked as such. what  is 
the subject matter of attack in these matters is a 
statute, namely, the muslim personal law ( shariat ) 
application act, 1937 (hereinafter referred to as t he 
â1937 actâ). according to them, E8 is 
specifically sanctioned by statutory law vide  section 2 
of the 1937 act and what is sought for is a declara tion 
that section 2 of the 1937 act is constitutionally invalid 
to the aforesaid extent."
"5. in a most illuminating introduction to mullaâs 
principles of mahomedan law (16 th  ed.) (1968),

"another noted author, a.a.a. fyzee, in his 
book âoutlines of muhammadan lawâ (5 th  ed. ), at 
pages 120-122, puts it thus: 
âthe pronouncement of talaq  may be either 
revocable or irrevocable."
"they are, therefore, the âapprovedâ forms 
and are recognized both by sunni and shia 
laws. the ithna ashari and the fatimi 
schools, however, do not recognize the 
remaining two forms and thus preserve the 
ancient conventions of the times of the 
law-giver. the first, or ahsan , form is âmost approvedâ 
because the husband behaves in a 
gentlemanly manner and does not treat the 
wife as a chattel."
"it is at this stage that the 1937 act needs 
consideration. the statement of objects and reason s 
of this act are as follows: 
âfor several years past it has been the 
cherished desire of the muslims of british 
india that customary law should in no 
case take the place of muslim personal 
law. the matter has been repeatedly 
agitated in the press as well as on the 
platform."
"the jamiat-ul-ulema-i-hind, the 
greatest moslem religious body has 
supported the demand and invited the 
attention of all concerned to the urgent 
necessity of introducing a measure to this 
effect. customary law is a misnomer in as 
much as it has not any sound basis to 
stand upon and is very much liable to 
frequent changes and cannot be expected 
to attain at any time in the future that 
certainty and definiteness which must be 
the characteristic of all laws. the status of 
muslim women under the so-called 
customary law is simply disgraceful."

"they

(shariat ) should be made applicable to 
them . the introduction of muslim personal 
law will automatically raise them to the 318 position to which they are naurally entitled. in addition to this present measure, if 
enacted, would have very salutary effect 
on society because it would ensure 
certainty and definiteness in the mutual 
rights and obligations of the public."
"in addition to this present measure, if 
enacted, would have very salutary effect 
on society because it would ensure 
certainty and definiteness in the mutual 
rights and obligations of the public. muslim 
personal law ( shariat ) exists in the form 
of a veritable code and is too well known to 
admit of any doubt or to entail any great 
labour in the shape of research, which is 
the chief feature of customary law.â 
    
 [emphasis supplied]  
 
12. it is a short act consisting of 6 sections."
"application of personal law to 
muslims. - notwithstanding any custom or 
usage to the contrary, in all questions (save 
questions relating to agricultural land) 
regarding intestate succession, special 
property of females, including personal 
properly inherited or obtained under 
contract or gift or any other provision of 
personal law, marriage, dissolution of 
marriage, including talaq , ila , zihar , lian , 
E3  and E4 , maintenance, dower, 
guardianship, gifts, trusts and trust 
properties, and wakfs  (other than charities 
and charitable institutions and charitable 
and religious endowments) the rule of 
decision in cases where the parties are 
muslims shall be the muslim personal law 
(shariat ).â 
 
13. a word as to the meaning of the expression 
âshariatâ."
"fyzee (supra), at pages 9-11, 
describes âshariatâ as follows: 319 âcoming to law proper, it is necessary to 
remember that there are two different 
conceptions of law. law may be considered 
to be of divine origin, as is the case with the 
hindu law and the islamic law, or it may be 
conceived as man-made. the latter 
conception is the guiding principle of all 
modern legislation; it is, as ostrorog has 
pointed out, the greek, roman, celtic or 
germanic notion of law."
"modern jurists emphasize the importance 
of law for understanding the character and 
ethos of a people. law, says a modern 
jurist, âstreams from the soul of a people 
like national poetry, it is as holy as the 
national religion, it grows and spreads like 
language; religious, ethical, and poetical 
elements all contribute to its vital forceâ; it is 
âthe distilled essence of the civilization of a 
peopleâ; it reflects the peopleâs soul more 
clearly than any other organism. this is 
true of islam more than of any other faith."
"obviously, moral 
obligation is quite a different thing from 
legal necessity and if in law these 
distinctions are not kept in mind error and 
confusion are the inevitable result.â 
 
14. it can be seen that the 1937 act is a pre-
constitutional legislative measure which would fall  
directly within article 13(1) of the constitution o f india, 
which reads as under: 
âarticle 13 - laws inconsistent with or in 
derogation of the fundamental rights - 
(1) all laws in force in the territory of india 322 immediately before the commencement of 
this constitution, in so far as they are 
inconsistent with the provisions of this part, 
shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, 
be void. (2) xxx xxx xxx 
(3) in this article, unless the context 
otherwise requires,- 
(a) âlawâ includes any ordinance, order, 
bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, 
custom or usage having in the territory of 
india the force of law; 
(b) âlaws in forceâ includes laws passed or 
made by a legislature or other competent 
authority in the territory of india before the 
commencement of this constitution and not 
previously repealed, notwithstanding that 
any such law or any part thereof may not 
be then in operation either at all or in 
particular areas.â

"i n a 
privy council decision in 1932, 5 years before the 1937 
act, namely rashid ahmad v.  anisa khatun , (1931-
32) 59 ia  21: air 1932 pc 25, the privy council was 
squarely called upon to adjudicate upon a triple ta laq. lord thankerton speaking for the privy council put it 
thus: 
âthere is nothing in the case to suggest 
that the parties are not sunni mahomedans 
governed by the ordinary hanafi law, and, 
in the opinion of their lordships, the law of 
E9 applicable in such a case is 
correctly stated by sir r.k wilson, in his 
digest of anglo-muhammadan law, 5th 
ed., at p. 136, as follows: âthe E9 
called talak  may be either irrevocable ( bain ) 
or revocable ( raja ). a talak bain , while it 
always operates as an immediate and 
complete dissolution of the marriage bond, 
differs as to one of its ulterior effects 
according to the form in which it is 
pronounced."
"the first-named of the 
above methods is called ahsan  (best), the 327 second hasan  (good), the third and fourth 
are said to be bidaat  (sinful), but are, 
nevertheless, regarded by sunni lawyers 
as legally valid.â  
                                                       (at page 
26) 
the privy council went on to state: 
âtheir lordships are of opinion that the 
pronouncement of the triple talak by 
ghiyas-ud-din constituted an immediately 
effective E9 and, while they are 
satisfied that the high court were not 
justified in such a conclusion on the 
evidence in the present case, they are of 
opinion that the validity and effectiveness of 
the E9 would not be affected by 
ghiyas-ud-dinâs mental intention that it 
should not be a genuine E9 as such a 
view is contrary to all authority. a talak 
actually pronounced under compulsion or in 
jest is valid and effective: baillieâs digest, 
2nd ed., p. 208; ameer aliâs mohammedan 
law, 3rd ed., vol. ii., p. 518; hamiltonâs 
hedaya, vol."
"if a 340 decision is taken without any principle or 
without any rule it is unpredictable and 
such a decision is the antithesis of a 
decision taken in accordance with the rule 
of law. (see dicey â âlaw of the 
constitutionâ â 10th edn., introduction cx). âlaw has reached its finest momentsâ, 
stated douglas, j. in united 
states  v. wunderlick  [342 us 98], âwhen it 
has freed man from the unlimited discretion 
of some rulerâ¦."
"(see dicey â âlaw of the 
constitutionâ â 10th edn., introduction cx). âlaw has reached its finest momentsâ, 
stated douglas, j. in united 
states  v. wunderlick  [342 us 98], âwhen it 
has freed man from the unlimited discretion 
of some rulerâ¦. where discretion, is 
absolute, man has always sufferedâ."
"and the 
constitutional law of 1975 has undergone 
many changes since a.v. dicey, the great 
expounder of the rule of law, delivered his 
lectures as vinerian professor of english 
law at oxford, which were published in 
1885 under the title, â introduction to the 
study of the law of the constitution â. but 
so much, i suppose, can be said with 
reasonable certainty that the rule of law 
means that the exercise of powers of 
government shall be conditioned by law 
and that subject to the exceptions to the 
doctrine of equality, no one shall be 
exposed to the arbitrary will of the 
government."
"we 
may not therefore rely wholly on diceyâs 
exposition of the rule of law but ever since 
the second world war, the rule has come to 
acquire a positive content in all democratic 
countries. [see wade and phillips: 
constitutional law (sixth edn., pp. 70-73)] 
the international commission of jurists, 
which has a consultative status under the 
united nations, held its congress in delhi 
in 1959 where lawyers, judges and law 
teachers representing fifty-three countries 
affirmed that the rule of law is a dynamic 
concept which should be employed to 
safeguard and advance the political and 
civil rights of the individual in a free society."
"to sum up, âprocedureâ in 
article 21 means fair, not formal 
procedure. âlawâ is reasonable 
law, not any enacted piece. as 
article 22 specifically spells out 
the procedural safeguards for 
preventive and punitive 
detention, a law providing for 
such detentions should conform 
to article 22."
