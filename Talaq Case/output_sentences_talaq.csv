"The Hanaf i Jurists 
however, have clearly laid down that in cases in whic h the application of 
Hanafi Law causes hardship, it is permissible to appl y the provisions of 
the “Maliki, Shafii or Hambali Law”.","The absence of such a provision has entailed unspeak able misery to 
innumerable Muslim women in British India.","Acting on this principle the Ulemas have issued fatwa s to the effect that 
in cases enumerated in clause 3, Part A of this Bill (now see section 2 of 
the Act), a married Muslim woman may obtain a decree d issolving her 
marriage."
"This view has been repeatedly challenged at the bar, but the 
Courts continue to stick to precedents created by rul ings based on an 
erroneous view of the Muslim Law.","The Courts in British India have held in a number of cases 
that the apostasy of a married Muslim woman ipso facto dissolves her

Hamilton's Hedaya, vol."
"Mere registration of divorce (or marriage ) even if proved, will 
not render valid divorce which is otherwise invalid under Muslim Law.” 
 
A perusal of the conclusion recorded by the High Co urt, through the 
above observations, leaves no room for any doubt, t hat the ‘talaq-e-biddat’ 
pronounced by the husband without reasonable cause,  and without being 
preceded by attempts of reconciliation, and without  the involvement of 
arbitrators with due representation on behalf of th e husband and wife, 54 would not lead to a valid divorce.","Registration of marriage and divorce unde r the Assam 
Muslim Marriages and Divorces Registration Act, 1935 i s voluntary, and 
unilateral.","The High Court also concluded, that the 
petitioner – Jiauddin Ahmed, had mainly alleged tha t he had pronounced 
talaq, but had not established the factum of divorc e by adducing any 
cogent evidence."
"The equivalent of the word 'div orce' is 'talaq' in 
Muslim Law.","The first point to be decided, therefore, is whether  the opposite party 
divorced the Petitioner.","What is valid 'talaq' in Muslim law was c onsidered by one of 
us (Baharul Islam, J. as he then was) sitting singly i n Criminal Revision 
No."
"I regret that I have to come to the conclusion tha t at the law 
stands at present, any Mohamedan may divorce his wife at his mere 
whim and caprice.” 56 Following Macnaghten, J. who held: ""there is no occasi on for any 
particular cause for divorce, and mere whim is suffi cient,'' and Batchelor, 
J, in case of Sarabai v. Babiabai (ILR 30 Bombay 53 7) Costello, J. held:— 
“It is good in law, though bad in theology.” 
Ameer Ali, in his Treatise on Mahomedan Law has obse rved: 
“The Prophet pronounced talaq to be a most destable thing  before the 
Almighty God of all permitted things.","In the case of Ahmed Kasim Molla v. Khatun Bibi repor ted in ILR Cal 
833, which has so long been regarded as a leading c ase on the law of 
divorce, Justice Costello held: 
“Upon that point (divorce), there are a number of author ities and I have 
carefully considered this point as dealt with in the very early authorities 
to see whether I am in agreement with the mere recent dec isions of the 
Courts.","If 'talaq' is given without any reason it is stupidity  and ingratitude to 
God.” 
The learned Author in the same book has also observed  
“The author of the Multeka (Ibrohim Halebi) is more c oncise."
"The emphasis 
was that a talaq would be valid only if it is effecte d in accordance with 
the Muslim Law.","in ILR 30 Madras 22  precisely held 
was that impropriety of the husband's conduct would in no way affect 
the legal validity of a divorce duly effected by the h usband.","In ILR 5, Rangoon 18, their Lordships of the Privy Co uncil observed: 
“According to that law (the Muslim Law), a husband ca n effect a divorce 
whenever he desires.” 
But the Privy Council has not said that the divorce need  not be duly 
effected or that procedure enjoined by the Quran need  not be followed."

"It is needless to say that Holy Quran is the primary  source and is the 
weightiest authority on any subject under the Muslim Law .",8.,"The Single 
Judge in Criminal Revision No."
"It seems that modern Indian Hanafi scholars have ta ken this opinion as well: the Compendium of Islamic  
Laws, 2001, Part II, Section 24, states the followi ng: “If a person pronouncing talaq says that he int ended 
only a single talaq and repeated the words of talaq  only to put emphasis and these words were not mean t 
to pronounce more than one talaq, his statement on oath will be accepted” .",p. 32.,Translated by Mahmood.
"(Also see: The Muslim Law of India, 3rd ed., Tahir Mahmood, Lexis Nexis Butterworths: New Delhi 
(2002),p.107, where the learned author noted: “In I ndia there has been no legislation in this regard, but 
the muftis of the time now agree that if a man pron ounces the so-called 'triple talaq' but later swear s that 
he did not mean it, his declaration may be given th e effect of a single talaq revocable during iddat a nd, if 
not so revoked, leaving room for a fresh nikah ther eafter with the wife's consent ”).",Translated by Mahmood.,"Such a view is, 
perhaps, based upon an application of the following  legal maxim of Islamic law - Al-umuru bi-
maqasidiha: Acts are judged by the intention behind  them."
"Personal Law in Islamic Countries, Tah ir 
Mahmood, Academy of Law and Religion: New Delhi (19 87).","Finally, many Muslim countries, 
including Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Sudan, S yria, and Yemen, have implemented laws that 
uphold the notion that a triple talak counts as onl y one talak.","3  4  
5  
6 See supra, fn 25 & 26, for the opinion of the Hanaf i madhab that triple talaq is sinful."
"(iii) The consideration :  The High Court took into consideration texts by 
renowned scholars, as for instance, from “Sharia” by  Wael B. Hallaq, 
“Sharia Law, An Introduction” by Mohammad Hashim Kama li, “Qur’an: The 
Living Truth” by Basheer Ahmad Mohyidin, “Muslim Law  in India And 
Abroad” by Dr. Tahir Mahmood, “The Lawful and the P rohibited in Islam” by 
Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, from the Urdu book “Hikma tul Islam” by 
Moulana Wahidul Khan.","The High Co urt therefore, embarked 
on the exercise of examining the validity of ‘talaq-e -biddat’.","The High Court also took into consideration 
Quranic verses (all of which have been, extracted ab ove)."
"Therefore, settlement of law relating to talaq is necessa ry and further 
discussion is to be treated as an allude for the State to consider for 
possible reforms of divorce Law of Muslim in this C ountry .","But rather it require a State 
intervention by way of legislation to regulate triple ta laq in India.","The empirical 
research placed herein justifies such course of acti on to remind the State 
for action."
Law required to be aligned with justice.,"Justice has become elusive 
for Muslim women in India not because of the religion  they profess, but 
on account of lack of legal formalism resulting in im munity from law .","The search f or solution to this 
predicament lies in the hands of the law makers."
"""Thus we display the revelations for people who have sense "" (Chapter 
30:28) 
The Registry shall forward the copy of this judgment to Union Law 
Ministry and Law Commission of India.” 67 A perusal of the conclusions drawn by the High Court r eveals, that the 
practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’, was deprecated by the Cou rt.","(Chapter 47:2) 
""And those who believe and do good works and believe in that which is 
revealed unto Muhammad - and it is the truth from their Lord-He riddeth 
them of their ill deeds and improveth their state .""","The Court 
however called upon the legislature, to codify the law  on the issue, as would 
result in the advancement of justice, as a matter of in stitutional form."
"Learned cou nsel concluded his 
submissions by quoting from the Constitutional Law of India, by H.M. 
Seervai (fourth edition, Volume 2, published by N.M. Tripathi Private Ltd., 
Bombay), wherein in clause 12.60, at page 1281, the author has expressed 
the following view: 
“12.60 I am aware that the enforcement of laws which a re violated is the

AIMPLB, that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ was derogatory to the dig nity of women, and 
that, it breaches the concept of gender equality."
"Law should be c apable to expand 
freedom of the people and the legal order can weigh w ith utmost equal 
care to provide the underpinning of the highly inequita ble social order.","To construe law one must enter 
into its spirit, its setting and history.","Judicial review must be exercised with insight into social values to 
supplement the changing social needs."
"Laws inconsistent with or in derogation of the fu ndamental rights.- 
(1) All laws in force in the territory of India imme diately before the 
commencement of this Constitution, in so far as they ar e inconsistent 
with the provisions of this Part, shall, to the extent of  such 
inconsistency, be void.","Article 13 reads as 
under:  
“13.","(2) The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the 
rights conferred by this Part and any law made in con travention of this 
clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void ."
"It was pointed out, that in the counter-affidavit dated August 2016, 
filed on behalf of the Muslim Personal Law Board, i. e., respondent no.3 to 
this petition, the practices of triple talaq (as well as, ‘nikah halala’ and 
polygamy) have been referred to as “undesirable”.","(2) If the 
phrase just quoted was intended to have such a wide op eration as 
cutting at even the essentials guaranteed by Article 25(1 ), there would 
have been no need for the special provision as to “t hrowing open of 
Hindu religious institutions” to all classes and secti ons of Hindus since 
the legislation contemplated by this provision would be par excellence 
one of social reform.”

28  AIR 1962 SC 853 120 submitted, that no “undesirable” practice can be conferr ed the status of an 
“essential practice”, much less one that forms the subs tratum of the 
concerned religion."
"In Indonesia , divorce is a judicial 
process, where those marrying under Islamic Law, ca n approach the 
Religious Court for a divorce, while others can appro ach District Courts for 
the same.","In Morocco and Indonesia, 
divorce proceedings take place in a secular court, pr ocedures of mediation 
and reconciliation are encouraged, and men and women  are considered 
equal in matters of family and divorce.","In Iran and Sri Lanka, divorce can be gra nted by a Qazi and/or a 
court, only after reconciliation efforts have failed."
"This assertion, was 
sought to be demonstrated, by placing reliance on the d efinition of the term 
‘personal law’ in Blacks Law Dictionary (10th  edition, 2014), as follows: 
“The law that governs a person’s family matters, regard less of where the 
person goes .","It was pointed out, that the personal affairs referre d to in the 
foregoing paragraph, fall in the realm of ‘personal law’.","In common law systems, personal law refers to the l aw of 
the person’s domicile."
"In civil-law systems, it refer s to the law of the 
individual’s nationality (and so is sometimes called  lex patriae).” 
Reference was also made to the definition of the term ‘personal law’ in 
‘Conflict of Laws 188’ (7 th  edition, 1974) by R.H. Graveson, who defined the 
term as under: 
“The idea of the personal law is based on the concept ion of man as a 
social being, so that those transactions of his daily l ife which affect him 
most closely in a personal sense, such as marriage, divorce, legitimacy, 
many kinds of capacity, and succession, may be gove rned universally by 
that system of law deemed most suitable and adequate fo r the purpose  
…” 
Based on the cumulative definition of the term ‘persona l law’, it was 
submitted, that the evolution of the matters of faith relati ng to religious 
practices, must necessarily be judged in the context of practices adopted by 
the concerned community, with reference to each indiv idual aspect of 
‘personal law’.","In common law systems, personal law refers to the l aw of 
the person’s domicile.","It was conceded, on behalf of the A IMPLB, that ‘personal 
laws’ were per se  subservient to legislation, and as such, ‘personal la ws’ 
were liable to be considered as mandatory, with refer ence to numerous 
aspects of an individual’s life, only in the absence  of legislation."
Law to be administered in cases of inheritance a nd succession.,"Section 112, 
aforementioned is extracted hereunder: 
“112.","– 
The high courts at Calcutta, Madras and Bombay, in the  exercise of their 
original jurisdiction in suits against inhabitants of Calcutta, Madras or 
Bombay, as the case may be, shall, in maters of inher itance and 
succession to lands, rents and goods, and in matters o f contract and 
dealing between party and party, when both parties ar e subject to the 
same personal law or custom having the force of law,  decide according to 
that personal law or custom, and when the parties are su bject to 
different personal laws or customs having  the force  of law, decide 
according to the law or custom to which the defendant is  subject .” 
It was pointed out, that in framing Article 13, the choice  of the words 
“custom and usage” and the exclusion of the expressio n “personal law” 
needed to be taken due note of."
"Take for instance the Hindu Law Draft which 
is before the Legislative Assembly.","What have these things got to  do with religion 
I really fail to understand.","If one looks at Ma nu and 
Yagnyavalkya and all the rest of them, I think most of the provisions of 
the new Bill will run counter to their injunctions."
"Look at 
Hindu Law; you get any amount of discrimination agains t women; and if 
that is part of Hindu religion or Hindu religious prac tice, you cannot 
pass a single law which would elevate the position o f Hindu women to  
that of men.","But you  have already passed 
a Fundamental Right to that effect and you have an artic le here which 
lays down that there should be no discrimination aga inst sex.","Therefore, there is no reason why there s hould not be a civil 
code throughout the territory of India ."
"They are willing to take lessons from the min ority and adapt 
their Hindu Laws and take a leaf from the Muslims for the purpose of 
reforming even the Hindu Law.","After all the only community that is willing to adapt  
itself to changing times seems to be the majority commun ity in the 
country.","Therefore, there is no force to the 
objection that is put forward to article 35 ."
"The unifo rm Civil Code 
will run into every aspect of Civil Law.","The future Legislatures may 
attempt a uniform Civil Code or they may not.","In regard to  contracts, procedure 
and property uniformity is sought to be secured by th eir finding a place 
in the Concurrent List."
"We have the Law of Transfer of 
Property, which deals with property relations and wh ich is operative 
throughout the country.","We have a uniform and complete C riminal Code 
operating throughout the country, which is contained in th e Penal Code 
and the Criminal Procedure Code.","Then there are the Negotiable Ins truments Acts: 
and I can cite innumerable enactments which would prov e that this  
country has practically a Civil Code, uniform in its c ontent and 
applicable to the whole of the country."
"The only provi nce the Civil Law 
has not been able to invade so far is Marriage and Su ccession.","Then there are the Negotiable Ins truments Acts: 
and I can cite innumerable enactments which would prov e that this  
country has practically a Civil Code, uniform in its c ontent and 
applicable to the whole of the country.","It is this 150 little corner which we have not been able to invade so  far and it is the 
intention of those who desire to have article 35 as part of the 
Constitution to bring about that change."
"Now I wish to challenge that statemen t. I think most 
of my friends who have spoken on this amendment have quite forgotten 
that up to 1935 the North-West Frontier Province was not subject to the 
Shariat Law.","My first observation would be to sta te that members 
who put forth these amendments say that the Muslim persona l law, so 
far as this country was concerned, was immutable and u niform through 
the whole of India.","It followed the Hindu Law in the matter of  succession and 
in other matters, so much so that it was in 1939 that the Central 
Legislature had to come into the field and to abrogate t he application of 
the Hindu Law to the Muslims of the North-West Frontier P rovince and 
to apply the Shariat Law to them."

"It is well-known fact and it is laid down in 
the Government of India Act, Section 107, that where a Fe deral Law 
comes into conflict with a Provincial Law and even if  the Federal Law has 
been passed after the Provincial Law, then to that ext ent it over-rides the

"It would therefore be a 
misnomer to consider that the Muslim Personal Law (Shar iat) Application 
Act, 1937, in any way, legislated on the above subject.","It was submitted, that the above enactment did not decide what

"Learned senior counsel focused his contentions,  firstly to the

the ground, that the same being unconstitutional, was unenforceable.","It would be relevant to mention, at the outset, that l earned senior 
counsel endorsed the submissions advanced by Mr. Kap il Sibal and Mr. 
Raju Ramachandra, Senior Advocates, who had assisted this Court before 
him.","Learned senior counsel, in order to raise his challe nge, first and foremost,

aforesaid, commenced with a non obstante  clause."
"It was therefore reiterated, that the legisla ture which enacted the 
Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, neither modified nor 
amended even in a small measure, the Muslim ‘persona l law’ applicable to 
the Muslims in India, nor did the legislature while e nacting the above 
enactment, subsumed the Muslim ‘personal law’, and the refore, the 
character of the Muslim ‘personal law’ did not undergo  a change on account 
of the enactment of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Ap plication Act, 
1937.","It was submitted, that the 1937 legisla tion was only 
statutorily declared that the Muslim ‘personal law’, as a set of rules, would 
govern the Muslims in India, and that, it would be the Muslim ‘personal law’ 
that would have an overriding effect over any custom or usage to the 
contrary.","According to learned senior counsel, the Musl im ‘personal law’ did 
not metamorphized into a statute, and as such, the rights  and duties of 
Muslims in India continued to be governed even after  the enactment of the 
Shariat Act, as before."
"It was therefore submitted that a challenge to the 
validity of Section 2 of the above enactment, so as to assail the validity of 174 ‘talaq-e-biddat’ as being contrary to the fundamental rig hts contained in 
Part III of the Constitution, was an exercise in futilit y.  Insofar as the 
instant assertion is concerned, learned senior counsel  advanced two 
submissions – firstly, that Section 2 of the Muslim Pers onal Law (Shariat) 
Application Act, 1937 did not by itself bring about an y law providing for 
rights and obligations to be asserted and discharged by the Muslims as a 
community, for the simple reason, that it only reaff irmed the perpetuieties

obligations of persons which were subjected to Musli m ‘personal law’ – 
‘Shariat’, continued as they existed prior to the enactm ent of the Shariat 
Act.","As such, it was contended, that it was  wholly unjustified to 
assume, that Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’ was giv en statutory effect, 
through the Shariat Act.","And secondly, the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Sh ariat’, was neither 
transformed nor metamorphized by the Shariat Act, in the nature of 
crystalised rules and regulations, and as such, even if Section 2 of the

Act.","Accordingly, it was pointed out, that the parameters of c hallenge, as were 
applicable to assail a statutory enactment, would not be  applicable in the 
matter of assailing the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shar iat’."
"This will  enable us to ascertain, 
whether the practice of talaq has a legislative sanction,  because it is the 
petitioner’s case, that it is so through express legislati on (-the Muslim 
Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937).","We will need  to determine, the legal 
sanctity of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple talaq.","But the stance adopted on 
behalf of those contesting the petitioner’s claim is, tha t its stature is that of 
‘personal law’, and on that account, the practice of ‘ talaq-e-biddat’ has a 
constitutional protection."
"The 179 asserted statutory status of Muslim ‘personal law’ (as h as been canvassed 
by the petitioners), emerged from the enactment of the Mus lim Personal Law 
(Shariat) Application Act, 1937.",The judgment in the Rashid Ahmad case 1 was rendered in 1932.,"The ‘Shariat’ Act ex pressly provided, that 
the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’, would constitu te “the rule of decision”, 
in causes where the parties were Muslim."

incorporated the manner in which questions regarding i ntestate succession,

marriage, including talaq, ila, jihar, lian, khula a nd mubaraat, 
maintenance, dower, guardianship, gifts, trusts and tr ust properties, and 
wakfs (-as in Section 2 thereof), had to be dealt with, as per Muslim 
‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’ according to the petitioner s, it would be quite a 
different matter.",117.,"All the same, the Shariat Act did not describe how the 
above questions and subjects had to be dealt with."
"Before we bid farewell to Fazlunbi it is necessa ry to mention that 
Chief Justice Baharul Islam, in an elaborate judgmen t replete with 
quotes from the Holy Quoran, has exposed the error of early English 
authors and judges who dealt with talaq in Muslim Law as good even if 
pronounced at whim or in tantrum, and argued against the  diehard view 
                                                 
36  (1980) 4 SCC 125 182 of Batchelor J. ILR 30 Bom 539 that this view ‘is goo d in law, though bad 
in theology’ .","Without pointedly examining the issue of the validi ty of ‘talaq-e-
biddat’, under the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’,  this Court in Fuzlunbi 
v. K. Khader Vali36 , recorded the following observations: 
“20.","Maybe, when the point directly arises, the question will 
have to be considered by this court, but enough unto the  day the evil 
thereof and we do not express our opinion on this ques tion as it does not 
call for a decision in the present case .” 
 
The above observations lead to the inference, that the pr oposition of law 
pronounced by the Privy Council in the Rashid Ahmad c ase 1, needed a 
relook."
"Referring  to the Principles of 
Mohomedan Law by Sir Dinshaw Fardunji Mulla (LexisN exis, Butterworths 
Wadhwa, Nagpur, 20 th  edition), it was asserted, that the ‘hadiths’ relied 192 upon by the AIMPLB (to which a reference will be mad e separately), were far 
– far removed from the time of the Prophet Mohammad.","To repudiate the 
veracity of the ‘hadiths’ relied upon by the responde nts, it was pointed out, 
that it was by now settled, that there were various degrees  of reliability 
and/or authenticity of different ‘hadiths’.","I t was explained,

authentic,  as with the passage of time, distortions wer e likely to set in,

require about three months."
"It was subm itted, that Dr. Tahir

position of ‘hadiths’.","Reference to Tafs ir Ibn Kathir was

was a follower of Ahl-e-Hadith school, and therefor e, his views could not be 
taken into consideration."
"Last of all, with reference to Mohammed Hashim 
Kamali, it was pointed out, that he was merely a Profess or of Law, and the 
views expressed by him should be considered as his personal views.","Abu Ameenah Bilal

breach of a rightful understanding of the school, an d the practice in 
question."
"V.  Did the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application  Act, 1937 confer  
statutory status to the subjects regulated by the said le gislation ?","We are of the view, that the practice  of ‘talaq-e-biddat’,

practiced it, and as such, there can be no doubt that the practice, is a part 
of their ‘personal law’.",146.
"The contention now being dealt with, was raised wi th the object of 
demonstrating, that after the enactment of the Muslim Per sonal Law 
(Shariat) Application Act, 1937, the questions and subj ects covered by the 
Shariat Act, ceased to be ‘personal law’, and got trans formed into ‘statutory 
law’.",147.,"It is in this context, that it was submitted, by Ms. Indira Jaising, 
learned senior counsel and some others, that the tag of ‘personal law’ got 
removed from the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’, after the enactment of 
the Shariat Act, at least for the questions/subjects with reference to which 
the legislation was enacted."
"A perusal of Section 2 thereof (ex tracted in paragraph 23 
above) reveals, that on the questions/subjects of intesta te succession, 
special property of females, including personal pro perty inherited or 
obtained under contract or gift or any other provision of ‘personal law’, 
marriage, dissolution of marriage, including talaq, ila, zihar, lian, khula and 
mubaraat, maintenance, dower, guardianship, gifts, trus ts and trust 
properties, and wakfs, “… the rule of decision …”, wh ere the parties are 
Muslims, shall be “… the Muslim Personal Law – Shar iat.","We have already enumerated the relevant provisio ns of the Shariat 
Act (-for details, refer to Part-4 – Legislation in In dia, in the field of Muslim 
‘personal law’).","The submission 
of the learned counsel representing the petitioners, in  support of the instant 
contention was, that since the “rule of the decision” inter alia  with reference 
to ‘talaq’ (-‘talaq-e-biddat’), was thereafter to be reg ulated in terms of the 
Shariat Act, what was ‘personal law’ (-prior to the abo ve enactment), came 
to be transformed into ‘statutory law’."
"Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel appear ing for the AIMPLB, 
drew our attention to the debates in the Legislative Asse mbly, whereupon, 
the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 193 7 was enacted (for 
details, refer to paragraph 94).",209 152.,"Having invited our a ttention to the above 
debates and more particularly to the statements of Abdu l Qaiyum 
(representing North-West Frontier Province), it was con tended, that the 
legislation under reference, was not enacted with the o bject of giving a 
statutory status to the Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat ’."
"Mr. V. Giri, learned senior counsel, supported the above contention 
by placing reliance on Section 2 of the Muslim Person al Law (Shariat) 
Application Act, 1937, on  behalf of the AIMPLB.",153.,"It w as asserted, that 210 Section 2 has a non obstante  clause."
"It was su bmitted, that the 
Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, d id not decide what 
was, and what was not, Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shari at’.","Learned senior counsel for the respondents desir ed us to accept 
their point of view, for yet another reason.","It was therefore 
pointed out, that it would be a misnomer to consider, tha t the Shariat Act, 
legislated in the field of Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘ Shariat’  in any manner on 
Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’."
"It was therefore 
contended, that it would be wholly improper to assume tha t Muslim 
‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’ was given statutory effect , through the Muslim 
Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937.","It was therefore contended, that the M uslim ‘personal law’ 
– ‘Shariat’ was never metamorphosed  into a statute.",155.
"Based on the above contentions, it was submitted, tha t the Muslim 
Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 cannot be  treated as having 
conferred statutory status on the Muslim ‘personal law’  – ‘Shariat’, and as 
such, the same cannot be treated as a statutory enactme nt, so as to be 
tested for its validity in the manner contemplated und er Article 13(1) of the 
Constitution.",155.,156.
"Having 
closely examined Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law  (Shariat) Application 
Act, 1937, we are of the view, that the limited purpose o f the aforesaid 
provision was to negate the overriding effect of usag es and customs over the 
Muslim ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’.","We have given our thoughtful consideration to the  submissions 
advanced at the hands of learned counsel for the rival  parties.","This determinati on of ours clearly 
emerges even from the debates in the Legislative Assem bly before the 
enactment of Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Applicatio n Act, 1937."

inter alia  to negate the overriding effect on customs and usage s over the

therefore constrained to accept the contention advanced by  learned counsel 
for the respondents, that the proposition canvassed on b ehalf of the 
petitioners, namely, that the Muslim Personal Law (Shar iat) Application Act, 
1937 conferred statutory status, on the questions/subje cts governed by the 
Shariat Act, cannot be accepted.","The 1939 
Act would form a part of ‘statutory law’, and not ‘per sonal law’.","That being the positio n, Muslim ‘personal 
law’ – ‘Shariat’ cannot be considered as a State enactm ent."
"In view of the conclusions recorded in the fore going paragraph, it is 
not possible for us to accept, the contention advanced o n behalf of the 
petitioners, that the questions/subjects covered by the Mus lim Personal 
Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 ceased to be ‘per sonal law’ and got 
transformed into ‘statutory law’.",157.,"Having concluded as above, we must also 
hold (-which we do), that the practices of Muslim ‘pers onal law’ – ‘Shariat’ 
cannot be required to satisfy the provisions contained in Part III – 
Fundamental Rights, of the Constitution, applicable to S tate actions, in 
terms of Article 13 of the Constitution."
"In our consideration recorded hereinabove, we h ave held, that the 
provisions of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Appl ication Act, 1937 did 
not alter the ‘personal law’ status of the Muslim ‘perso nal law’ – ‘Shariat’.",158.,We shall now deal with the next step.

consequent upon it are of such importance to the we lfare of humanity, that a high degree 
of sanctity is attached to it.","The above view has been endorsed by various High Co urts,

by the apex Court, is that talaq must be for a 
reasonable cause and must be preceded by 
attempt at reconciliation between the husband 
and the wife by two arbiters one chosen by wife's

is only if their attempts fail, talaq may be effect ed.","In A. S. Parveen Akthar  v. The Union of India 60 , the

"The mere 
pronouncement of talaq three times even in the 
presence of the wife is not sufficient to effect a 
divorce under Mohammadan Law.","The only thing to be further considered in this 
case is whether the divorce alleged to have been 
effected by the husband by pronouncement of 
talaq on 23-7-1999 is proved or not.","As held by the 
Supreme Court in Shamim Ara's  case [2002 (3) KLT 
537 (SC)], there should be an attempt of mediation 
by two mediators; one on the side of the husband 
and the other on the side of the wife and only in 
case it was a failure that the husband is entitled to 
pronounce talaq to divorce the wife… ”

the subject matter of attack in these matters is a 
statute, namely, the Muslim Personal Law ( Shariat )

like national poetry, it is as holy as the 
national religion, it grows and spreads like 
language; religious, ethical, and poetical 
elements all contribute to its vital force’; it is 
‘the distilled essence of the civilization of a 
people’; it reflects the people’s soul more 
clearly than any other organism.","Modern jurists emphasize the importance 
of law for understanding the character and 
ethos of a people.","This is 
true of Islam more than of any other faith."
"It can be seen that the 1937 Act is a pre-
constitutional legislative measure which would fall  
directly within Article 13(1) of the Constitution o f India, 
which reads as under: 
“Article 13 - Laws inconsistent with or in 
derogation of the fundamental rights - 
(1) All laws in force in the territory of India 322 immediately before the commencement of 
this Constitution, in so far as they are 
inconsistent with the provisions of this part, 
shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, 
be void.","Obviously, moral 
obligation is quite a different thing from 
legal necessity and if in law these 
distinctions are not kept in mind error and 
confusion are the inevitable result.” 
 
14.","(2) xxx xxx xxx 
(3) In this article, unless the context 
otherwise requires,- 
(a) “law” includes any Ordinance, order, 
bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, 
custom or usage having in the territory of 
India the force of law; 
(b) “laws in force” includes laws passed or 
made by a Legislature or other competent 
authority in the territory of India before the 
commencement of this Constitution and not 
previously repealed, notwithstanding that 
any such law or any part thereof may not 
be then in operation either at all or in 
particular areas.”

"Lord Thankerton speaking for the Privy Council put it 
thus: 
“There is nothing in the case to suggest 
that the parties are not Sunni Mahomedans 
governed by the ordinary Hanafi law, and, 
in the opinion of their Lordships, the law of 
divorce applicable in such a case is 
correctly stated by Sir R.K Wilson, in his 
Digest of Anglo-Muhammadan Law, 5th 
ed., at p. 136, as follows: “The divorce 
called talak  may be either irrevocable ( bain ) 
or revocable ( raja ).","I n a 
Privy Council decision in 1932, 5 years before the 1937 
Act, namely Rashid Ahmad v.  Anisa Khatun , (1931-
32) 59 IA  21: AIR 1932 PC 25, the Privy Council was 
squarely called upon to adjudicate upon a Triple Ta laq.","A talak bain , while it 
always operates as an immediate and 
complete dissolution of the marriage bond, 
differs as to one of its ulterior effects 
according to the form in which it is 
pronounced."
"A talak 
actually pronounced under compulsion or in 
jest is valid and effective: Baillie’s Digest, 
2nd ed., p. 208; Ameer Ali’s Mohammedan 
Law, 3rd ed., vol.","The first-named of the 
above methods is called ahsan  (best), the 327 second hasan  (good), the third and fourth 
are said to be bidaat  (sinful), but are, 
nevertheless, regarded by Sunni lawyers 
as legally valid.”  
                                                       (at page 
26) 
The Privy Council went on to state: 
“Their Lordships are of opinion that the 
pronouncement of the triple talak by 
Ghiyas-ud-din constituted an immediately 
effective divorce, and, while they are 
satisfied that the High Court were not 
justified in such a conclusion on the 
evidence in the present case, they are of 
opinion that the validity and effectiveness of 
the divorce would not be affected by 
Ghiyas-ud-din’s mental intention that it 
should not be a genuine divorce, as such a 
view is contrary to all authority.","ii., p. 518; Hamilton’s 
Hedaya, vol."
"(See Dicey — “Law of the 
Constitution” — 10th Edn., Introduction cx).","If a 340 decision is taken without any principle or 
without any rule it is unpredictable and 
such a decision is the antithesis of a 
decision taken in accordance with the rule 
of law.","“Law has reached its finest moments”, 
stated Douglas, J. in United 
States  v. Wunderlick  [342 US 98], “when it 
has freed man from the unlimited discretion 
of some ruler…."
"“Law has reached its finest moments”,

States  v. Wunderlick  [342 US 98], “when it 
has freed man from the unlimited discretion 
of some ruler….","(See Dicey — “Law of the 
Constitution” — 10th Edn., Introduction cx).","Where discretion, is 
absolute, man has always suffered”."
"Dicey, the great 
expounder of the rule of law, delivered his 
lectures as Vinerian Professor of English 
law at Oxford, which were published in 
1885 under the title, “ Introduction to the 
Study of the Law of the Constitution ”.","And the 
Constitutional law of 1975 has undergone 
many changes since A.V.","But 
so much, I suppose, can be said with 
reasonable certainty that the rule of law 
means that the exercise of powers of 
Government shall be conditioned by law 
and that subject to the exceptions to the 
doctrine of equality, no one shall be 
exposed to the arbitrary will of the 
Government."
"[See Wade and Phillips: 
Constitutional Law (Sixth Edn., pp.","We 
may not therefore rely wholly on Dicey’s 
exposition of the rule of law but ever since 
the second world war, the rule has come to 
acquire a positive content in all democratic 
countries.","70-73)] 
The International Commission of Jurists, 
which has a consultative status under the 
United Nations, held its Congress in Delhi 
in 1959 where lawyers, judges and law 
teachers representing fifty-three countries 
affirmed that the rule of law is a dynamic 
concept which should be employed to 
safeguard and advance the political and 
civil rights of the individual in a free society."
"‘Law’ is reasonable 
law, not any enacted piece.","To sum up, ‘procedure’ in 
Article 21 means fair, not formal 
procedure.","As 
Article 22 specifically spells out 
the procedural safeguards for 
preventive and punitive 
detention, a law providing for 
such detentions should conform 
to Article 22."
