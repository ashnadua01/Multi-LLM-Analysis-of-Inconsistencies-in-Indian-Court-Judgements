"the  respondents  contended:  (1)  article  32  of  the
constitution is  not attracted  to the  instant case  as  no
fundamental right  of  the  petitioner  or  of  the  workmen
referred to  in the  petition is  infringed;  (2)  a  letter
addressed by  a party  to this  court cannot be treated as a

is  not   empowered  to   appoint  any   commission  or   an

value; and  (5) there might be forced labourers in the stone
quarries and stone crushers in the state of haryana but they
were  not  bonded  labourers  within  the  meaning  of  that
expression as  used in  the E2 system (abolition)

petition on merits, the court

     held:  the  state  government's  objection  as  to  the
maintainability of the writ petition under article 32 of the
constitution by  the petitioners  is reprehensible."
"it is  the fundamental  right of  every one in
this country,  assured under  the  interpretation  given  to
article 21  by this  court in francis mullen's case, to live
with human  dignity, free  from exploitation. this right to
live with  human dignity enshrined in article 21 derives its
life breath  from the  directive principles  of state policybandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983

articles 41  and 42  and at  the least,  therefore, it  must
include protection  of the  health and  strength of workers,
men and  women, and  of the  tender age  of children against
abuse, opportunities  and facilities for children to develop
in a  healthy  manner  and  in  conditions  of  freedom  and
dignity, educational  facilities, just and humane conditions
of  work   and  maternity  relief. these  are  the  minimum
requirements which must exist in order to enable a person to
live with  human dignity  and no  state neither  the central
government nor  any state  government-has the  right to take
any action  which will  deprive a person of the enjoyment of
these basic  essentials."
"it must also follow as
a necessary corollary that the state of haryana in which the
stone quarries  are vested  by reason  of  haryana  minerals
(vesting of  rights) act  1973 and  which is  therefore  the
owner of  the mines  cannot while giving its mines for stone
quarrying  operations,  permit  workmen  to  be  denied  the
benefit of  various social  welfare and  labour laws enacted
with a  view to  enabling them  to  live  a  life  of  human
dignity. the state of haryana must therefore ensure that the

enforced against  the central  government and  the state  of
haryana  by   a  writ  petition  under  article  32  of  the
constitution."
"clause (1) of article 32 says that the supreme court
can be  moved for  enforcement of a fundamental right by any
'appropriate' proceeding. there

proceeding must  be ""appropriate""  and this  requirement  of
appropriateness must  be judged  in the light of the purpose
for which the proceeding is to be taken, namely, enforcement
of a fundamental right. the constitution makers deliberately
did not  lay down  any particular  form  of  proceeding  for
enforcement of  a fundamental  right nor  did they stipulate
that such  proceeding should conform to any rigid pattern or
straight jacket formula as, for example, in england, because
they knew  that in  a country  like india, where there is so
much of  poverty,  ignorance,  illiteracy,  deprivation  and
exploitation,  any   insistence  on   a  rigid   formula  of
proceeding for  enforcement of  a  fundamental  right  would
become self  defeating because it would place enforcement of
fundamental rights  beyond the  reach of  the common man and
the entire  remedy for  enforcement  of  fundamental  rights
which the  constitution makers  regarded as  so precious and
invaluable  that  they  elevated  it  to  the  status  of  a
fundamental right,  would become  a mere rope of sand so far
as the  large masses  of the  people  in  this  country  are
concerned."
"public  interest litigation  is not in the nature of
adversary  litigation   but  it   is  a   challenge  and  an
opportunity to the government and its officers to make basic
human rights  meaningful  to  the  deprived  and  vulnerable
sections of  the community  and to  assure them  social  and
economic  justice   which  is  the  signature  tune  of  our
constitution. when  the court  entertains  public  interest,
litigation, it  does not do so in a cavilling spirit or in a
confrontational mood  or with a view to tilting at executive
authority or  seeking to  unsurp it, but its attempt is only
to  ensure   observance  of   social  and   economic  rescue
programmes, legislative as well as executive, framed for the
benefit of  the have-nots and the handicapped and to protect
them against violation of their basic human rights, which isbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 7also the  constitutional obligation  of the  executive. the
court is  thus merely  assisting in  the realisation  of the
constitutional objectives."

     8. it  is not  at all  obligatory that  an  adversarial
procedure, where each party produces his own evidence tested
by cross  examination by  the other  side and the judge sitsbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 8like an  umpire and  decides the  case only  on the basis of
such material as may be produced before him by both parties,
must be  followed in  a  proceeding  under  article  32  for
enforcement of  a fundamental  right. in  fact, there  is no
such constitutional  compulsion enacted  in  clause  (2)  of
article 32  or in  any other part of the constitution."
"therefore   the  courts  should  abandon  the
laissez faire  approach in the judicial process particularly
where it  involves a  question of enforcement of fundamental
rights and forge new tools, devise new methods and adopt new
strategies for  the purpose  of  making  fundamental  rights
meaningful for  the large  masses of  people. and  this  is
clearly permissible on the language of clause (2) of article
32 because  the  constitution  makers  while  enacting  that
clause have  deliberately and  advisedly not  used and wordsbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983

"in fact,
the jurisdiction  of the  high courts  under article  226 is
much wider, because the high courts are required to exercise
this jurisdiction  not only for enforcement of a fundamental
right but  also for enforcement of any legal right and there
are many  rights conferred on the poor and the disadvantaged
which are  the creation  of statute  and  they  need  to  be

so also  it applies  to  every  contractor  who  employs  or
employed five or more inter-state migrant workmen on any day
of the  preceding twelve months. section (2) sub-section (1)
clause (b)  of the act defines contractor, in relation to an
establishment, to  mean ""a person who undertakes (whether as
an independent  contractor, agent, employee or otherwise) to

"the act was brought into force through out the
length and  breadth of  the country  with effect  from  25th
october 1975, which means that the act has been in force now
for almost  8 years  and if  properly implemented, it should
have by  this time  brought about  complete  identification,

trial with  the normal  procedure for recording of evidence. that would be a totally futile process because it is obvious
that a  E2ers  can never stand up to the regidity

government might  as  well  obliterate  this  act  from  the
statute book. it is now statistically established that most
of bonded  labourers are  members of  scheduled  castes  and
scheduled tribes  or other  backward  classes  and  ordinary
course of  human affairs  would show, indeed judicial notice
can be  taken of  it, that  there would be no occasion for a
labourer to be placed in a situation where he is required to
supply E1 for no wage or for nominal wage, unless
he has received some advance of other economic consideration
from the  employer and  under  the  consideration  from  the
employer and  under the  pretext of not having returned such
advance or  other economic  consideration, he is required to
render service to the employer or is deprived of his freedom
of employment  or of  the right  to move  freely wherever he
wants."
"it may  be that  according to the government of
haryana there  were not  at any  time any  bonded  labourers
within its territories, but even so vigilance committees are
required  by  section  13  to  be  constituted  because  the
function of  the vigilance  committee is  to identify bonded
labourers, if  there are  any, and  to free and rehabilitate
them and  it would not be right for the state government not
to constitute  vigilance committees  on the  assumption that
there are  no  bonded  labourers  at  all. in  constituting
vigilance committee  in each  district and sub-division, the
haryana government  would do well to include representatives
of non-political social action groups operating at the grass
root level, for it is only through such social action groupsbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983

     the magistrates  and  judicial  officers  take  a  very
lenient view  of violations  of labour  laws enacted for the
benefits of the workmen and let off the defaulting employers
with small  fines."
"these handicaps  have denied millions of
our countrymen access to justice. public interest litigation
is said to possess the potential or providing such access in
the milieu of a new ethos, in which participating sectors inbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983

organisation has  taken on  a radically  new dimension,  and
correspondingly  new  perspectives  are  opening  up  before
judges and  lawyers and  state law  agencies  in  the  tasks
before them."
"despite  the varying  fortunes of the number of
cases of  public interest  litigation which have entered the

a significant  segment of the court's docket. [154 d: 156 a-bandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983

while  the   legislature  enacts   the  law   the  executive
implements it  and the court interprets it and, in doing so,
adjudicates on  the validity  of executive  action and under

marginal degree of legislative exercise. nonetheless, a fine
and delicate  balance is  envisaged under  our  constitution

"but, it appears that though the constitution was enacted as far back as 26th

indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 33only in 1976 that parliament enacted the E2 system (abolition) act,
1976 providing for the abolition of E2 system with a view to preventing
the economic and physical exploitation of the weaker sections of the people. but,
unfortunately, as subsequent events have shown and that is borne out also by the
report made by the centre for rural development administration, indian institute
of public administration to the ministry of labour government of india on
""rehabilitation of E2 in monghyr district, bihar"", the report made by
the public policy and planning division of the indian institute of public
administration to the ministry of labour, government of india on ""evaluation study
of E2 rehabilitation scheme in tehri garhwal, u.p."
"it is a problem which needs
urgent attention of the government of india and the state governments and when the directive
principles of state policy have obligated the central and the state governments to take steps and
adopt measures for the purpose of ensuring social justice to the have-notes and the handicapped, it
is not right on the part of the concerned governments to shut their eyes to the inhuman exploitation
to which the E2ers are subjected. it is not uncommon to find that the administration inbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 34some states is not willing to admit the existence of E2 even though it exists in their
territory and there is incontrovertible evidence that it does so exist. we fail to see why the
administration should feel shy in admitting the existence of E2 because it is not the
existence of E2 that is a slur on the administration but its failure to take note of it and to
take all necessary steps for the purpose of putting an end to the E2 system by quickly
identifying, releasing and permanently rehabilitating E2ers."
"but we do not wish to
anitcipate the discussion in regard to this argument and at the present stage we content ourselves by
merely observing that it is unfortunate that any state government should take up the plea that
persons who are forced to provided labour may be forced labourers but unless it is shown by them
by proper evidence tested by cross-examination that they are E14 against a
bonded debt, they cannot be said to be bonded labourers and the state government cannot be held
to be under any obligation to rehabilitate them. the petitioner made a survey of some of the stone quarries in faridabad district near the city of
delhi and found that there were a large number of labourers from maharashtra, madhya pradesh,
uttar pradesh and rajasthan who were working in these stone quarries under ""inhuman andbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983

investigation in the following terms:
""it is necessary that a socio-legal investigation should be carried out for the purpose
of determining what are the conditions prevailing in the various quarries in

will or without their consent and what are the conditions in which they are living and
whether any of the provisions of the E2 system (abolition) act andbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 38inter- state migrant workmen (regulation of employment & conditions of service)
act is being violated. we may make it clear that when we are directing a socio-legal
investigation of these matters it is not in a spirit to criticise the state government or
any of its officers but with a view to find out the correctness of the state of affairs so
that the state government and its officers could take necessary steps for remedying
the situation if a state of affairs exists which is contrary to the provisions of law and
the basic human norms."
"it took
some time for dr. patwardhan to complete his assignment and prepare his report but having regard
to the immensity of the task, the time within which dr. patwardan finished the inquiry and
submitted his report was remarkably short. we shall have occasion to refer to this report a little
latter when we deal with the arguments advanced on behalf of the parties, but we may point out atbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 39this stage that the report of dr. patwardhan a comprehensive, well documented socio- legal study of
the conditions in which the workmen engaged in stone quarries and stone crushers live and work
and it has made various constructive suggestions and recommendations for the purpose of
improving the living conditions of these workmen. we are indeed grateful to dr. patwardhan for
carrying out this massive assignment so efficiently and in such a short time."
"we can appreciate the anxiety of
the mine lessees to resist the writ petition on any ground available to them, be it hyper-technical or
even frivolous, but we find it incomprehensible that the state government should urge such a
preliminary objection with a view to stifling at the thresh-hold an inquiry by the court as to whether
the workmen are living in bondage and under inhuman conditions. we should have thought that if
any citizen brings before the court a complaint that a large number of peasants or workers are
bonded serfs or are being subjected to exploitation by a few mine lessees or contractors or
employers or are being denied the benefits of social welfare laws, the state government, which is,
under our constitutional scheme, charged with the mission of bringing about a new socioeconomic
order where there will be social and economic justice for every one and equality of status andbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 40opportunity for all, would welcome an inquiry by the court, so that if it is found that there are in fact
E2ers or even if the workers are not bonded in the strict sense of the term as defined in
the E2 system (abolition) act 1976 but they are made to provide E1 or are
consigned to a life of utter deprivation and degradation such a situation can be set right by the state
government. even if the state government is on its own inquiry satisfied that the workmen are not
bonded and are not compelled to provide E1 and are living and working in decent
conditions with all the basic necessities of life provided to them, the state government should not
baulk an inquiry by the court when a complaint is brought by a citizen, but it should be anxious to
satisfy the court and through the court the people of the country, that it is discharging its
constitutional obligation fairly and adequately and the workmen are being ensured social and
economic justice."
"this right to live with
human dignity, enshrined in article 21 derives its life breath from the directive principles of state
policy and particularly clauses (e) and (f) of article 39 and article 41 and 42 and at the least,
therefore, it must include protection of the health and strength of workers men and women, and of
the tender age of children against abuse, opportunities and facilities for children to develop in
healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity, educational facilities, just and humane
conditions of work and maternity relief. these are the minimum requirements which must exist in
order to enable a person to live with human dignity and no state neither the central government
nor any state government-has the right to take any action which will deprive a person of thebandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 41enjoyment of these basic essentials. since the directive principles of state policy contained in
clauses (e) and (f) of article 39, article 41 and 42 are not enforceable in a court of law, it may not be
possible to compel the state through the judicial process to make provision by statutory enactment
or executive fiat for ensuring these basic essentials which go to make up a life of human dignity but
where legislation is already enacted by the state providing these basic requirements to the workmen
and thus investing their right to live with basic human dignity, with concrete reality and content, the
state can certainly be obligated to ensure observance of such legislation for inaction on the part of
the state in securing implementation of such legislation would amount to denial of the right to live
with human dignity enshrined in article 21, more so in the context of article 256 which provides
that, the executive power of every state shall be so exercised as to ensure compliance with the laws
made by parliament and any existing laws which apply in that state."
"article 32 is so frequently used by lawyers and
judges for enforcement of fundamental rights without any preliminary objection against its
invocation being raised on behalf of the state, that we have rarely any occasion to examine its
language and consider how large is the width and amplitude of its dimension and range. we are so
much accustomed to the concepts of anglo-saxon jurisprudence which require every legalbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 42proceeding including a proceeding for a high prerogative writ to be cast in a rigid or definitive mould
and insist on observance of certain well settled rules of procedure, that we implicitly assume that the
same sophisticated procedural rules must also govern a proceeding under article 32 and the
supreme court cannot permit itself to be freed from the shackles of these rules even if that be
necessary for enforcement of a fundamental right. it was on the basis of this impression fostered by
long association which the anglo-saxon system of administration of justice that for a number of
years this court had taken the view that it is only a person whose fundamental right is violated who
can approach the supreme court for relief under article 32 or in other words, he must have a cause
of action for enforcement of his fundamental right."
"there is no limitation in the words of clause (1) of article 32 that the
fundamental right which is sought to be enforced by moving the supreme court
should be one belonging to the person who moves the supreme court nor does it say
that the supreme court should be moved only by a particular kind of proceeding. it is
clear on the plain language of clause (1) of article 32 that whenever there is abandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 43violation of a fundamental right any one can move the supreme court for
enforcement of such fundamental right. of course, the court would not, in exercise of
its discretion, intervene at the instance of a meddlesome interloper or busy body and
would ordinarily insist that only a person whose fundamental right is violated should
be allowed to activise the court, but there is no fetter upon the power of the court to
entertain a proceeding initiated by any person other than the one whose fundamental
right is violated, though the court would not ordinarily entertain such a proceeding,
since the person whose fundamental right is violated can always approach the court
and if he does not wish to seek judicial redress by moving the court, why should some
one else be allowed to do so on his behalf."
"the constitution makers therefore advisedly provided in clause (1) of article 32 that the
supreme court may be moved by any 'appropriate' proceeding, 'appropriate' not in terms of any
particular form but 'appropriate' with reference to the purpose of the proceeding. that is the reason
why it was held by this court in the judges appointment and transfer case (supra) that where a
member of the public acting bona fide moves the court for enforcement of a fundamental right on
behalf of a person or class of persons who on account of poverty or disability or socially or
economically disadvantaged position cannot approach the court for relief, such member of the
public may move the court even by just writing a letter, because it would not be right or fair to
expect a person acting pro bono publico to incur expenses out of his own pocket for going to a
lawyer and preparing a regular writ petition for being filed in court for enforcement of the
fundamental right of the poor and deprived sections of the community and in such a case, a letterbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 44addressed by him can legitimately be regarded as an ""appropriate"" proceeding. but the question then arises as to what is the power which may be exercised by the supreme court
when it is moved by an ""appropriate"" proceeding for enforcement of a fundamental right."
"in fact, there is no such constitutional compulsion enacted in
clause (2) of article 32 or in any other part of the constitution. it is only because we have beenbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 45following the adversarial procedure for over a century owing to the introduction of the anglo-saxon
system of jurisprudence under the british rule that it has become a part of our conscious as well as
sub-conscious thinking that every judicial proceeding must be cast in the mould of adversarial
procedure and that justice cannot be done unless the adversarial procedure is adopted. but it may be
noted that there is nothing sacrosanct about the adversarial procedure and in fact it is not followed
in many other countries where the civil system of law prevails."
"and this is clearly permissible on the language of clause
(2) of article 32 because the constitution makers while enacting that clause have deliberately and
advisedly not used any words restricting the power of the court to adopt any procedure which it
considers appropriate in the circumstances of a given case for enforcing a fundamental right. it is
true that the adoption of this non-traditional approach is not likely to find easy acceptance from thebandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 46generality of lawyers because their minds are conditioned by constant association with the existing
system of administration of justice which has become ingrained in them as a result of long years of
familiarity and experience and become part of their mental make up and habit and they would
therefore always have an unconscious predilection for the prevailing system of administration of
justice. but if we want the fundamental rights to become a living reality and the supreme court to
become a real sentinel on the quivive, we must free ourselves from the shackles of outdated and
outmoded assumptions and bring to bear on the subject fresh outlook and original unconventional
thinking."
"to accept this contention would be to
introduce the adversarial procedure in a proceeding where in the given situation, it is totally
inapposite. the learned additional solicitor general and mr. phadke relied on order xxvi of the
code of civil procedure and order xlvi of the supreme court rules 1966 for the purpose of
contending that a commission can be appointed by the supreme court only for the purpose of
examining witnesses, making legal investigations and examining accounts and the supreme courtbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 47has no power to appoint a commission for making an inquiry or investigation into facts relating to a
complaint of violation of a fundamental right in a proceeding under article 32. now it is true that
order xlvi of the supreme court rules 1966 makes the provisions of order xxvi of the code of
civil procedure, except rules 13, 14, 19, 20, 21 and 22 applicable to the supreme court and days
down the procedure for an application for issue of a commission, but order xxvi is not exhaustive
and does not detract from the inherent power of the supreme court to appoint a commission, if the
appointment of such commission is found necessary for the purpose of securing enforcement of a
fundamental right in exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction under article 32."

(a) the depth of the excavation measured from its highest to its lowest point nowhere
exceeds six metres;
(b) the number of persons employed on any one day does not exceed fifty; and
(c) explosives are not used in connection with the excavation."" since the workings in these stone quarries extend below superjacent ground and they are not `open

necessary steps for the purpose of securing compliance with these provisions by the mine-lessees

"there is also a provision made in section 15 for
payment to an inter-state migrant workman of a journey allowance of a sum not less than the fare
from the place of residence in his state to the place of work in the other state, both for outward and

as defined in section 2 sub-section (1) clause (b) and the workmen recruited by or through him from
other states for employment in the stone quarries and stone crushers in the state of haryana would
undoubtedly be inter- state migrant workmen. even when the thekedar or jamadar recruits or
employs workmen for the stone quarries and stone crushers by sending word through the ""old

meaning of section 2(1)(a) is under an obligation to take necessary steps for the
purpose of securing compliance with these provisions by the thekedar or jamadar and
mine-lessees and owners of stone crushers."
"every contractor is made responsible
under-section 21 for payment of wages to each worker employed by him as contract labour and such
wages are to be disbursed in the presence of a representative duly authorised by the principal
employer. now if the jamadar or thekedar in a stone quarry or stone crusher is a 'contractor' within
the meaning of the definition of that term in the inter-state migrant workmen act, he would a
fortiorari be a 'contractor' also for the purpose of contract labour act and any workmen hired in orbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983

thekedar would be workmen entitled to the benefit of the provisions of the contract labour act. there are elaborate rules made under the contract labour act called the contract labour
(regulation and abolition) central rules 1971 (hereinafter referred to as the contract labour rules)
and these rules not only deal with the procedure for application and grant of registration to a
principal employer and licence to a contractor, but also particularise the details of the various
welfare and other facilities directed to be provided to the contract labour by section 16, 17, 18 and 19
of the contract labour act."
"it is also stated in the report of dr. patwardhan that the workmen
employed in the stone quarries not only quarry the stone but also carry out the work of a shot firer
and a stone breaker, though the work of a shot firer cannot be done by them without proper training
as provided in the mines vocational training rules 1966 and for this work of a shot firer and a stone
breaker carried cut by them, they do not get the minimum wage stipulated for the occupation of a
shot firer or a stone breaker and moreover since they are piece-rated workers, their output falls
because of the other jobs they are required to carry out with the result that they are deprived of the
minimum wage which they should otherwise receive. we are not in a position at the present stage to
give a definite finding that what is stated in the report of dr. patwardhan is true, but there can be
no doubt that whatever be the mode of payment followed by the mine lessees and stone crusher
owners, the workmen must get nothing less than the minimum wage for the job which is beingbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 56carried out by them and if they are required to carry out additionally any of the functions pertaining
to another job or occupation for which a separate minimum wage is prescribed, they must be paid a
proportionate part of such minimum wage in addition to the minimum wage payable to them for the
work primarily carried out by them. we would also suggest that the system of payment which is
being followed in the stone quarries and stone crushers, under which the expenses of the explosives
and of drilling holes are to be borne by the workmen out of their own wages, should be changed and
the explosives required for carrying out blasting should be supplied by the mine lessees or the
jamadar or thekedar without any deduction being made out of the wages of the workmen and the
work of drilling holes and shot firing should be entrusted only to those who have received the
requisite training under the mines vocational training rules 1966."
"the expression 'bonded labourer' is defined in clause (f) to mean ""a labourer who incurs, or
has, or is presumed to have incurred a bonded debt"". clause (g) defines ""bonded labour system"" to
mean:

(b) where no such wage has been fixed in relation to any form of labour, the wages that are normally

"section 5 invalidates any custom or tradition or any contract agreement or other instrument by
virtue of which any person or any member of the family or dependent of such person is required to
do any work or render any service as a E2er. section 6 provides inter alia that on the
commencement of the act, every obligation of a E2er to repay and bonded debt or such
part of any bonded debt as remains unsatisfied immediately before such commencement, shall be
deemed to have been extinguished.bandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 58there are certain other consequential provisions in section 7 to 9 but it is not necessary to refer to
them. sections 10 to 12 impose a duty on every district magistrate and every officer to whom power
may be delegated by him, to inquire whether, after the commencement of the act, any bonded
labour system or any other form of E1 is being enforced by or on behalf of, any person
resident within the local limits of his jurisdiction and if, as a result of such inquiry, any person is
found to be enforcing the E2 system or any other system of E1, he is required
forthwith to take the necessary action to eradicate the enforcement of such E1."
"it was contended by the learned additional solicitor general on behalf of the state of haryana that
in the stone quarries and stone crushers there might be E1ers but they were not bonded
labourers within the meaning of that expression as used in the act, since a labourer would be a
E2er only if he has or is presumed to have incurred a bonded debt and there was nothing
in the present case to show that the workmen employed in the stone quarries and stone crushers
had incurred or could be presumed to have incurred any bonded debt. it was not enough, contended
the learned additional solicitor general the petitioner merely to show that the workmen werebandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 59providing E1 in that they were not allowed to leave the premises of the establishment, but
it was further necessary to show that they were working under the E2 system. the
learned additional solicitor general also submitted that in any event, even if the workmen filed
affidavits to the effect that they had taken advances from thekedar or jamadar and or mine lessees
and/or stone crusher owners and they were not allowed to leave the premises of the establishment
until the advances were paid of, that would not be enough evidence for the court to hold that they
were E2ers, because the mine-lessees and stone crusher owners had no opportunity to
cross-examine the workmen making such affidavits."
"it was on the basis of this
definitional requirement that the learned additional solicitor general on behalf of the state of
haryana put forward the argument that even if the workmen employed in the stone quarries and
stone crushers were being compelled to provide E1 they were not E2ers,
since it as not shown by them or by the petitioner that they were doing so in consideration of an
advance or other economic consideration received from the mine-lessees and owners of stone
crushers. now if this contention of the learned additional solicitor general were well-founded, it
would become almost impossible to enforce the provisions of the E2 system (abolition)
act 1976 because in every case where E2ers are sought to be identified for the purpose of
release and rehabilitation under the provisions of the act, the state authorities as also the employer
would be entitled to insist that the E2ers must first prove that they are providing forced
labour in consideration of an advance or other economic consideration received by them and then
only they would be eligible of the benefits provided under the act and this would make it extremely
difficult, if not impossible, for the labourers to establish that they are E2ers because they
would have no evidence at all to prove that any advance or economic consideration was provided to
them by the employer and since employment of E2ers is a penal offence under the actbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 60the employer would immediately, without any hesitation, disown having given any advance or
economic consideration to the E2ers. it is indeed difficult to understand how the state
government which is constitutionally mandated to bring about change in the life conditions of the
poor and the down-trodden and to ensure social justice to them, could possibly take up the stand
that the labourers must prove that they are made to provide E1 in consideration of an
advance or other economic consideration received from the employer and are therefore bonded
labourers."
"it is therefore necessary to impress upon the
administration that it does not help to ostrich-like bury its head in the sand and ignore the
prevalence of E2 for it is not the existence of E2 that is a slur on the
administration but its failure to eradicate it and moreover not taking the necessary steps for the
purpose of wiping out this blot on the fair name of the state is a breach of its constitutional
obligation. we would therefore direct the government of haryana and also suggest to the other
state governments, to take steps to sensitise the officers concerned with the implementation of thebandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 61act to this acute human problems and its socioeconomic parameters. moreover it may be noted that
the district magistrates have a central role to play under the provisions of the act and the state
governments would therefore do well to instruct the district magistrates to take up the work of
identification of E2 as one of their top priority tasks."
"it may be pointed out that
the concept of rehabilitation has the following four main features as admirably set out in the letter
dated 2nd september 1982 addressed by the secretary. ministry of labour, government of india to
the various states governments:
(i) psychological rehabilitation must go side by side with physical and economic
rehabilitation;bandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 62(ii) the physical and economic rehabilitation has 15 major components namely
allotment of house-sites and agricultural land, land development, provision of low
cost dwelling units, agriculture, provision of credit, horticulture, animal husbandry,
training for acquiring new skills and developing existing skills, promoting traditional
arts and crafts, provision of wage employment and enforcement of minimum wages,
collection and processing of minor forest produce, health medical care and sanitation
supply of essential commodities, education of children of bonded labourers and
protection civil rights;
(iii) there is scope for bringing about an integration among the various central and
centrally sponsored schemes and the on-going schemes of the state governments for
a more qualitative rehabilitation. the essence of such integration is to avoid duplication i.e."
"we cannot ignore this material which has
been placed before us and unquestioningly accept the statement made on behalf of the state of
haryana that there is no E2 in the stone quarries and stone crushers. but at the same
time, we do not think that it would be right for us on the basis of this material to come to a definitebandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 63finding that these workers whose names are given in the report of m/s ashok srivastava and ashok
panda or who have filed affidavits are providing E1 or are E2ers. it is
necessary to direct a further inquiry for the purpose of ascertaining whether any of the labourers
working in the stone quarries and stone crushers in faridabad district are E2ers in the
light of the law laid down by us in this judgment."
"it may not be a matter
of any consequence as to which mode of payment is followed, whether the workmen are paid on
truck basis or on any other basis, but what is essential is and that is what the minimum wages act
1948 requires that the workmen must not receive any wage less than the minimum wage. even ifbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 64payment of wages is made to the workmen on truck basis, a formula would have to be evolved by the
central government and the state of haryana to ensure that the workmen receive no less than the
minimum wage and to facilitate this formula it would have to be provided that the expenses on
explosives and drilling holes shall be borne by the mine-lessees and or the jamadar or thekedar and
the work of drilling holes and shot firing shall be entrusted only to those who have received requisite
training under the mines vocational training rules 1966. we would direct the central government
and the state of haryana to take the necessary steps in this behalf so that within the shortest
possible time and as far as possible within  from  the workmen start actually receiving
in their hands a wage not less than the minimum wage."
"the knowledge of their rights and entitlements will give them
the strength to fight against their employers for securing their legitimate dues and it will go a long
way towards reducing, if not eliminating, their exploitation. we have fortunately in our country the
central board of workers education which is entrusted with the function of educating workers in
their rights and entitlements and we would therefore direct the central board of workers educationbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983

for the purpose of creating awareness amongst the workmen about the rights and benefits conferred
upon them by social welfare laws. this educational campaign shall be taken up by the central board
of workers education as early as possible and the progress made shall be reported to this court by
the central board of workers education from time to time, at least once in "
"if shri laxmi dhar misra finds as a result of his inquiry that the contract labour act
and/or the inter-state migrant workmen act is applicable, he will make a report to that effect to the
court on or before 15th february 1984. we may make it clear that this inquiry by shri laxmi dhar
misra is not directed for the purpose of fastening any liability on the mine-lessees and stone crusher
owners or the jamadars and thekedars proprio vigore on the basis of such report, but merely for the
purpose of considering whether a prima facie case exists on the basis of which action can be initiated
by the central government, in which the mine- lessees and stone crusher owners and/or the
jamadars or thekedars would have an opportunity of contesting the allegation that the contract
labour act and/or the inter- state migrant workmen act applies to their stone quarry or stone
crusher and defending such action.bandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983

relates to the failure to A39 to the workmen in most of the stone quarries
and stone crushers."
"the central government and the state of
haryana will also take steps for ensuring that the vessels in which drinking water is kept by the
mine-lessees and stone crusher owners are kept in clea and hygienic condition and are emptied,
cleaned and refilled every day and they shall also ensure that minimum wage is paid to the women
and/or children who look after the vessels. the chief labour commissioner, the deputy chief

shall supervise strictly the enforcement of this obligation and initiate necessary action if there is any
default. the central government as also the state of haryana will also immediately direct the
mine-lessees and stone-crusher owners to start obtaining drinking water from any unpolluted
source or sources of supply and to transport it by tankers to the works site with sufficient frequency
so as to be able to keep the vessels filled up for supply of clean drinking water to the workmen."
"the report of dr. patwardhan shows that no such facilities are
provided to the workmen employed in the stone quarries and stone crushers and this finding was
not seriously disputed on behalf of the respondents. it is indeed regrettable that despite there being
a mandatory provision for medical and first aid facilities in section 21 of the mines act 1952 andbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 68rules 40 to 45a of the mines rules 1955, no medical or first aid facilities seem to be provided in the
stone quarries and stone crushers. we would therefore direct the central government as also the
state government to take steps to immediately ensure that proper and adequate medical and first
aid facilities as required by section 21 of the mines act 1952 and rules 40 to 45a of the mines rules
1955 are provided by the mine-lessees and owners of stone quarries to the workmen."
"it is also necessary to point out that
whenever any workman suffers any E6 or contracts any E7 in the course of employment, he
is entitled to compensation under the workmens' compensation act 1923, but unfortunately he is
very often not in a position to approach the appropriate court or authority for enforcing his claim to
compensation and even if he files such a claim, it takes a long time before such claim is disposed of
by the court or authority. we would therefore direct that as soon as any workman employed in a
stone quarry or stone crusher receives E6 or contracts E7 in the course of his employment,
the concerned mine-lessee or stone crusher owner shall immediately report this fact to the chiefbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983

inspecting officers shall immediately provide legal assistance to the workman with a view to
enabling him to file a claim for compensation before the appropriate court or authority and they
shall also ensure that such claim is pursued vigorously and the amount of compensation awarded to
the workman is secured to him. we would like to impress upon the court or authority before which
a claim for compensation is filed by or on behalf of the workman to dispose of such claim without
any undue delay, since delay in the awarding of compensation to the workman would only and to his
misery and helplessness and would be nothing sort of gross denial of justice to him."
"we would therefore strongly impress upon the magistrates and judicial officers to
take a strict view of violation of labour laws and to impose adequate punishment on the erring
employers so that they may realise that it does not pay to commit a breach of such laws and to deny
the benefit of such laws to the workmen. we accordingly allow this writ petition and issue the above directions to the central government
and the state of haryana and the various authorities mentioned in the preceding paragraphs of this
judgment so that these poor unfortunate workmen who lead a miserable existence in small hovels,

the monopoly of a few but belongs to them all and that they are also equally entitled along with
others to participate in the fruits of freedom and development. these directions may be summarized
as follows (1) the government of haryana will, without any delay and at any rate within 
from  constitute vigilance committee in each sub- division of a district in compliance with the
requirements of section 13 of the E2 system (abolition) act 1976 keeping in view the
guidelines given by us in this judgment."
"(7) the central government will direct the inspecting officers of the central enforcement
machinery or any other appropriate inspecting officers to carry out surprise checks at least once in a
 for the purpose of ensuring that the trucks are not loaded beyond their true measurement
capacity and if it is found that the trucks are loaded in excess of the true measurement capacity, the
inspecting officers carrying out such checks will immediately bring this fact to the notice of the
appropriate authorities and necessary action shall be initiated against the defaulting mine owners
and/or thekedars or jamadars. (8) the central government and the government of haryana will ensure that payment of wages is
made directly to the workmen by the mine lessees and stone crusher owners or at any rate in the

order to ensure that the payment of the stipulated wage is made to the workmen. (9) the central board of workers education will organise periodic camps near the sites of stone
quarries and stone crushers in faridabad district for the purpose of educating the workmen in the
rights and benefits conferred upon them by social welfare and labour laws and the progress made
shall be reported to this court by the central board of workers education at least once in three

as required by rule 45 of the mines rules 1955. (17) the central government and the state government will immediately take steps to ensure that
proper and adequate medical treatment is provided by the mine lessees and owners of stone

such medical assistance shall be made available to them without any cost of transportation or

those who see interference by the courts in public interest litigation as a series of quixotic forays in a
world of unyielding and harsh reality, whose success in the face of opposition bolstered by the
inertia and apathy of centuries is bound to be limited in impact and brief in duration. they see
judicial endeavour frustrated by the immobility of public concern and a traditional resistance to

"in the usual form, the suit is an organised proceeding between two individual
contestants. it deals with a definite framework of facts requiring identification

on behalf of the underprivileged and deprived sections of society for the fulfillment of
their aspirations. it is not necessary to detail the number of cases of public interest
litigation which have entered this court."
"it is only
comparatively recently that the court has begun to call for the filing of a regular
petition on the letter. i see grave danger inherent in a practice where a mere letter is
entertained as a petition from a person whose antecedents and status are unknown or
so uncertain that no sense of responsibility can, without anything more, be attributedbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983

grossest impropriety."

possibility, in public interest litigation, of succumbing to the temptation of crossingbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983

government. for in most cases the jurisdiction of the court is invoked when a default
occurs in executive administration, and sometimes where a void in community life
remains unfilled by legislative action."
"in most
cases of public interest litigation, there will be neither precedent nor settled practice
to add weight and force to the vitality of the court's action. the example of similarbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 83cases in other countries can afford little support. the successful implementation of
the orders of the court will depend upon the particular social forces in the backdrop
of local history, the prevailing economic pressures, the duration of the stages
involved in the implementation, the momentum of success from stage to stage, and
acceptance of the court's action at all times by those involved in or affected by it."
"there is great merit in the court proceeding to decide an issue on the basis of strict legal principle

jurisprudence which makes it a base for the next step forward in the further progress of the law. indeed, both certainty of substance and certainty of direction are indispensable requirements in the
development of the law, and invest it with the credibility which commands public confidence in its
legitimacy."
"on the merits of the case i find myself in agreement with my brother bhagwati, both in regard to the
operation of the various statutes as well as the directions proposed by him. the case is one of
considerable importance to a section of our people, who pressed by the twin misfortunes of povertybandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983

assurances extended by our constitution to its citizens."
"there cannot be any manner of doubt that

"when this court is approached on behalf of this class of people for enforcement of
fundamental rights of which they have been deprived and which they are equally entitled to enjoy, it
becomes the special responsibility of this court to see that justice is not denied to them and the
disadvantageous position in which they are placed, do not stand in the way of their getting justice
from this court. the power to appoint a commission or an investigating body for making enquiries
in terms of directions given by the court must be considered to be implied and inherent in the

"on the merits of the case my learned brother bhagwati, j. has in his judgment
carefully and elaborately discussed all the aspects. apart from the principal grievance
made that the workmen in the instant case are bonded labourers, various grievances
on behalf of the workmen have been voiced and denial to the workmen of variousbandhua mukti morcha vs union of india & others on 16 december, 1983
