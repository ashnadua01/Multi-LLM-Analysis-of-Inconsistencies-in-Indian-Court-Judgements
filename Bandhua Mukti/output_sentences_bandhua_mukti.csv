"HEADNOTE:
     The petitioner,  an organisation dedicated to the cause
of release  of bonded  labourers in the country, addressed a
letter to Hon'ble Bhagwati, J. alleging: (1) that there were
a large  number of  labourers from  different parts  of  the
country who  were working  in some  of  the  stone  quarriesBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 2situate in district Faridabad, State of

Haryana under  ""inhuman and intolerable conditions; (2) that
a large  number of  them were bonded labourers; (3) that the
provisions of  the Constitution  and various  social welfare
laws passed  for the  benefit of  the said  workmen were not
being  implemented   in  regard   to  these  labourers.","Minimum Wages  Act, Workmen's  Compensation Act,  1983,
Payment  of   Wages  Act,  Employees  State  Insurance  Act,
Employees Provident  fund and  Miscellaneous Provisions Act,
Maternity Benefits  Act, 1957-Benefits  accruing under these
Acts-Whether available to mine workers.","The
petitioner also  mentioned in  the letter  the names  of the
stone quarries and particulars of labourers who were working
as bonded  labourers and  prayed that  a writ  be issued for
proper implementation  of  the  various  provisions  of  the
social welfare legislations, such as, Mines Act, 1952 Inter-
State  Migrant   Workmen  (Regulation   of  Employment   and
Conditions  of   Service)   Act,   1979,   Contract   Labour
(Regulation and  Abolition) Act,  1970, Bonded Labour System

Insurance Act,  Maternity Benefits  Act etc."
"32, this Court
is  not   empowered  to   appoint  any   commission  or   an
investigating body  to enquire  into the allegations made in
the writ  petition; (4) Reports made by such commissions are
based only on ex-parte statements which have not been testedBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 3by cross-examination  and therefore they have no evidentiary
value; and  (5) there might be forced labourers in the stone
quarries and stone crushers in the State of Haryana but they
were  not  bonded  labourers  within  the  meaning  of  that
expression as  used in  the Bonded Labour System (Abolition)
Act, 1976.","The  respondents  contended:  (1)  Article  32  of  the
Constitution is  not attracted  to the  instant case  as  no
fundamental right  of  the  petitioner  or  of  the  workmen
referred to  in the  petition is  infringed;  (2)  A  letter
addressed by  a party  to this  Court cannot be treated as a
writ petition; (3) In a proceeding under Art.","Rejecting all  the contentions  and allowing  the  writ
petition on merits, the Court
^
     HELD:  The  State  Government's  objection  as  to  the
maintainability of the writ petition under Article 32 of the
Constitution by  the petitioners  is reprehensible."
"This right to
live with  human dignity enshrined in Article 21 derives its
life breath  from the  Directive Principles  of State PolicyBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 4and particularly  clauses (e)  and (f)  of  Article  39  and
Articles 41  and 42  and at  the least,  therefore, it  must
include protection  of the  health and  strength of workers,
men and  women, and  of the  tender age  of children against
abuse, opportunities  and facilities for children to develop
in a  healthy  manner  and  in  conditions  of  freedom  and
dignity, educational  facilities, just and humane conditions
of  work   and  maternity  relief.","It is  the fundamental  right of  every one in
this country,  assured under  the  interpretation  given  to
Article 21  by this  Court in Francis Mullen's Case, to live
with human  dignity, free  from exploitation.","These  are  the  minimum
requirements which must exist in order to enable a person to
live with  human dignity  and no  State neither  the Central
Government nor  any State  Government-has the  right to take
any action  which will  deprive a person of the enjoyment of
these basic  essentials."
"The State of Haryana must therefore ensure that the
minelessees or  contractors, to  whom it is giving its mines
for  stone  quarrying  operations,  observe  various  social
welfare and  labour laws  enacted for  the  benefit  of  theBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 5workmen.","It must also follow as
a necessary corollary that the State of Haryana in which the
stone quarries  are vested  by reason  of  Haryana  Minerals
(Vesting of  Rights) Act  1973 and  which is  therefore  the
owner of  the mines  cannot while giving its mines for stone
quarrying  operations,  permit  workmen  to  be  denied  the
benefit of  various social  welfare and  labour laws enacted
with a  view to  enabling them  to  live  a  life  of  human
dignity.","This  is a  constitutional obligation  which can be
enforced against  the Central  Government and  the State  of
Haryana  by   a  writ  petition  under  Article  32  of  the
Constitution."
"There
71
is no  limitation  in  regard  to  the  kind  of  proceedingBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 6envisaged in  clause (1)  of  Article  32  except  that  the
proceeding must  be ""appropriate""  and this  requirement  of
appropriateness must  be judged  in the light of the purpose
for which the proceeding is to be taken, namely, enforcement
of a fundamental right.","Clause (1) of Article 32 says that the Supreme Court
can be  moved for  enforcement of a fundamental right by any
'appropriate' proceeding.","The Constitution makers deliberately
did not  lay down  any particular  form  of  proceeding  for
enforcement of  a fundamental  right nor  did they stipulate
that such  proceeding should conform to any rigid pattern or
straight jacket formula as, for example, in England, because
they knew  that in  a country  like India, where there is so
much of  poverty,  ignorance,  illiteracy,  deprivation  and
exploitation,  any   insistence  on   a  rigid   formula  of
proceeding for  enforcement of  a  fundamental  right  would
become self  defeating because it would place enforcement of
fundamental rights  beyond the  reach of  the common man and
the entire  remedy for  enforcement  of  fundamental  rights
which the  Constitution makers  regarded as  so precious and
invaluable  that  they  elevated  it  to  the  status  of  a
fundamental right,  would become  a mere rope of sand so far
as the  large masses  of the  people  in  this  country  are
concerned."
"When  the Court  entertains  public  interest,
litigation, it  does not do so in a cavilling spirit or in a
confrontational mood  or with a view to tilting at executive
authority or  seeking to  unsurp it, but its attempt is only
to  ensure   observance  of   social  and   economic  rescue
programmes, legislative as well as executive, framed for the
benefit of  the have-nots and the handicapped and to protect
them against violation of their basic human rights, which isBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 7also the  constitutional obligation  of the  executive.","Public  Interest litigation  is not in the nature of
adversary  litigation   but  it   is  a   challenge  and  an
opportunity to the government and its officers to make basic
human rights  meaningful  to  the  deprived  and  vulnerable
sections of  the community  and to  assure them  social  and
economic  justice   which  is  the  signature  tune  of  our
Constitution.","The
Court is  thus merely  assisting in  the realisation  of the
constitutional objectives."
"It  is not  at all  obligatory that  an  adversarial
procedure, where each party produces his own evidence tested
by cross  examination by  the other  side and the judge sitsBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 8like an  umpire and  decides the  case only  on the basis of
such material as may be produced before him by both parties,
must be  followed in  a  proceeding  under  Article  32  for
enforcement of  a fundamental  right.","[108 B-H, 109 A-B]
     8.","In  fact, there  is no
such constitutional  compulsion enacted  in  clause  (2)  of
Article 32  or in  any other part of the Constitution."
"And  this  is
clearly permissible on the language of clause (2) of Article
32 because  the  Constitution  makers  while  enacting  that
clause have  deliberately and  advisedly not  used and wordsBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 9restricting the  power of  the court  to adopt any procedure
which it  considers appropriate  in the  circumstances of  a
given case for enforcing a fundamental right.","Therefore   the  Courts  should  abandon  the
laissez faire  approach in the judicial process particularly
where it  involves a  question of enforcement of fundamental
rights and forge new tools, devise new methods and adopt new
strategies for  the purpose  of  making  fundamental  rights
meaningful for  the large  masses of  people.","[110 B-F]

"To acceptBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 10this  contention  would  be  to  introduce  the  adversarial
procedure in  a proceeding  where in the given situation, it
is totally inapposite.","But it would not be
correct to  say that  the report  of the commissioner has no
evidentiary value at all, since the statements
74
made in  it are  not tested  by cross-examination.","[111 B-H, 112, A-B]

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 11     3: 1.","In fact,
the jurisdiction  of the  High Courts  under Article  226 is
much wider, because the High Courts are required to exercise
this jurisdiction  not only for enforcement of a fundamental
right but  also for enforcement of any legal right and there
are many  rights conferred on the poor and the disadvantaged
which are  the creation  of statute  and  they  need  to  be
enforced as  urgently and  vigorously as fundamental rights.","The Stone  quarries  in  the  instant  case  are
""mines"" within the meaning of the Section 2 (j) of the Mines
Act, 1952  since they  are excavations  where operations for
the purpose of searching for or obtaining stone by quarrying
are being  carried on  but they  are not  open cast working'
since admittedly  excavations in  the case  of  these  stone
quarries extend below superjacent ground."

five or  more inter-State  Migrant workmen  are employed  or

so also  it applies  to  every  contractor  who  employs  or
employed five or more inter-State migrant workmen on any day
of the  preceding twelve months.","[113  G-H, 114 A, 115 A, E, G,

     13.","Section (2) sub-section (1)
Clause (b)  of the Act defines contractor, in relation to an
establishment, to  mean ""a person who undertakes (whether as
an independent  contractor, agent, employee or otherwise) to
produce a  given result  for the establishment, other than a
mere supply  of goods  and articles  of manufacture  to such
establishment, by  the employment  of workmen  or to  supply

     14.","But
this liability  is not  confined  only  to  the  contractor,
because Section  18 provides  in so  many terms  that if any
allowance required  to be  paid under-section 14 or 15 to an
inter-State migrant workman is not paid by the contractor or
if any  facility specified in Section 16 is not provided for
the benefit of such workman, such allowance shall be paid or
as the  case may  be, the  facility shall be provided by the
principal employer  within such time as may be prescribed by
the Rules  and all  the allowances  paid  by  the  principal
employer or  all  the  expenses  incurred  by  him  in  this
connection may  be recovered  by  him  from  the  contractor
either  by   deduction  from   the  amount  payable  to  the
contractor or as a debt payable by the contractor.","The  thekedar or jamadar who is engaged by the mine
lessees or  the stone  crusher owners  to recruit workmen or
employ them  on behalf  of the mine lessees or stone crusher
owners would clearly be a 'contractor' within the meaning of
that term as defined in Section 2 sub-section (1) clause (b)
and the  workmen recruited  by or  through  him  from  other
States for  employment  in  the  stone  quarries  and  stone
crushers in the State of Haryana would undoubtedly be inter-
State migrant  workman ."
"Where  therefore  the  thekedar  for
Jamadar is  a Contractor,  and the  workmen are  employed as
'contract labour' within the meaning of these expressions as
used in  the Contract  Labour Act  the Contractor as well asBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 14the principal  employer would  be liable  to comply with the
provisions of  the Contract  Labour  Act  and  the  Contract
Labour Rules  and to  provide to  the contract labour rights
and benefits  conferred by  these  provisions.","If  the Jamadar  or thekadar  in a  stone quarry or
stone crusher  is a  contractor' within  the meaning  of the
definition of the term in the Inter-State Migrant
77
Workmen Act,  he would a fortiorari be 'contractor' also for
the purpose  of Contract Labour Act and any workmen hired in
or in  connection with  the work  of stone  quarry or  stone
crusher by  or through  the jamadar  or  thekedar  would  be
workmen entitled  to the  benefit of  the provisions  of the
Contract  Labour  Act.","The  Central
Government being  the ""appropriate  government""  within  the
meaning of  section 2  sub-section (1)  clause (a)  would be
responsible for  ensuring compliance  with the provisions of
the Contract Labour Act and the Contract Labour Rules by the
mine-lessees and  stone crushers  owners and the thekedar or
jamadar."
"But  asBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 15official, semi-official  and non-official  reports show,  we
have yet to go a long way in wiping out this outrage against
humanity.","The Act was brought into force through out the
length and  breadth of  the country  with effect  from  25th
October 1975, which means that the Act has been in force now
for almost  8 years  and if  properly implemented, it should
have by  this time  brought about  complete  identification,
freeing  and   rehabilitation  of   bonded  labour.","[126 A-C]
     18."
"That would be a totally futile process because it is obvious
that a  bonded labourers  can never stand up to the regidity
and formalism  of the  legal process  due  to  his  poverty,
illiteracy and  social and economic backwardness and if suchBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 16a  procedure   were  required  to  be  followed,  the  State
Government might  as  well  obliterate  this  Act  from  the
statute book.","[130 F-H, 131 A]
     It would  be cruel  to insist  that a  bonded labour in
order  to   derive  the  benefits  of  this  social  welfare
legislation, should  have to  go through a formal process of
trial with  the normal  procedure for recording of evidence.","It is now statistically established that most
of bonded  labourers are  members of  Scheduled  Castes  and
Scheduled Tribes  or other  backward  classes  and  ordinary
course of  human affairs  would show, indeed judicial notice
can be  taken of  it, that  there would be no occasion for a
labourer to be placed in a situation where he is required to
supply forced labour for no wage or for nominal wage, unless
he has received some advance of other economic consideration
from the  employer and  under  the  consideration  from  the
employer and  under the  pretext of not having returned such
advance or  other economic  consideration, he is required to
render service to the employer or is deprived of his freedom
of employment  or of  the right  to move  freely wherever he
wants."
"In  constituting
Vigilance Committee  in each  District and sub-division, the
Haryana Government  would do well to include representatives
of non-political social action groups operating at the grass
root level, for it is only through such social action groupsBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 17and voluntary  agencies that  the problems of identification
of bonded labour can be effectively solved.","It may  be that  according to the Government of
Haryana there  were not  at any  time any  bonded  labourers
within its territories, but even so Vigilance Committees are
required  by  Section  13  to  be  constituted  because  the
function of  the Vigilance  Committee is  to identify bonded
labourers, if  there are  any, and  to free and rehabilitate
them and  it would not be right for the State Government not
to constitute  vigilance Committees  on the  assumption that
there are  no  bonded  labourers  at  all.","[128 E-H, 129 A-
B]
     The magistrates  and  judicial  officers  take  a  very
lenient view  of violations  of labour  laws enacted for the
benefits of the workmen and let off the defaulting employers
with small  fines."
"Public interest litigation
is said to possess the potential or providing such access in
the milieu of a new ethos, in which participating sectors inBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 18the administration of justice cooperate in the creation of a
system  which   promises  legal  relief  without  cumbersome
formality and  heavy expenditure.","These handicaps  have denied millions of
our countrymen access to justice.","In the  result, the legal
organisation has  taken on  a radically  new dimension,  and
correspondingly  new  perspectives  are  opening  up  before
judges and  lawyers and  State Law  agencies  in  the  tasks
before them."

cases of  public interest  litigation which have entered the
Supreme Court,  Public Interest Litigation constitutes today
a significant  segment of the court's docket.","The  provisions of  Article 32 do not specifically
indicate who  can move  the  Court."
"This requirement isBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 20all the  greater where  petitions are  received by the Court
through  the   post.","Therefore,  in  special  circumstances  the
document  petitioning   the  court   for  relief  should  be
supported by  satisfactory verification.","It   is  never  beyond  the  bound  of
possibility  that   an  unverified   communication  received

holds a position of honour and respect in society."
"In  public interest  litigation, the  role held by
the Court  is more  assertive than  in traditional  actions.Bandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 21Viewed from  the Warren  Court's experience  the role of the

positive attitude  in determining  facts.","[158 E-H;

public interest litigation affects the rights of persons not

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 23certain sphere  the legislature  is  possessed  of  judicial
power, the executive possesses a measure of both legislative
and judicial  functions, and  the  court,  in  its  duty  of
interpreting the law, accomplished in its perfected action a
marginal degree of legislative exercise.","It  is common  place  that
while  the   legislature  enacts   the  law   the  executive
implements it  and the court interprets it and, in doing so,
adjudicates on  the validity  of executive  action and under

"In that task theBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983

confidence and support, and that consequently the legitimacy

the economic and physical exploitation of the weaker sections of the people.","But, it appears that though the Constitution was enacted as far back as 26th
January, 1950 and many years passed since then, no serious effort was made to give
effect to Article 23 and to stamp out the shocking practice of to bonded labour.","But,
unfortunately, as subsequent events have shown and that is borne out also by the
Report made by the Centre for Rural Development Administration, Indian Institute
of Public Administration to the Ministry of Labour Government of India on

territory and there is incontrovertible evidence that it does so exist.","It is a problem which needs
urgent attention of the Government of India and the State Governments and when the Directive

adopt measures for the purpose of ensuring social justice to the have-notes and the handicapped, it
is not right on the part of the concerned governments to shut their eyes to the inhuman exploitation
to which the bonded labourers are subjected.","We fail to see why the
administration should feel shy in admitting the existence of bonded labour, because it is not the
existence of bonded labour that is a slur on the administration but its failure to take note of it and to
take all necessary steps for the purpose of putting an end to the bonded labour system by quickly
identifying, releasing and permanently rehabilitating bonded labourers."

anitcipate the discussion in regard to this argument and at the present stage we content ourselves by
merely observing that it is unfortunate that any State Government should take up the plea that
persons who are forced to provided labour may be forced labourers but unless it is shown by them
by proper evidence tested by cross-examination that they are forced to provide labour against a
bonded debt, they cannot be said to be bonded labourers and the State Government cannot be held

any citizen brings before the Court a complaint that a large number of peasants or workers are
bonded serfs or are being subjected to exploitation by a few mine lessees or contractors or
employers or are being denied the benefits of social welfare laws, the State Government, which is,
under our constitutional scheme, charged with the mission of bringing about a new socioeconomic
order where there will be social and economic justice for every one and equality of status andBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 40opportunity for all, would welcome an inquiry by the court, so that if it is found that there are in fact
bonded labourers or even if the workers are not bonded in the strict sense of the term as defined in
the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976 but they are made to provide forced labour or are
consigned to a life of utter deprivation and degradation such a situation can be set right by the State
Government.","We can appreciate the anxiety of
the mine lessees to resist the writ petition on any ground available to them, be it hyper-technical or
even frivolous, but we find it incomprehensible that the State Government should urge such a
preliminary objection with a view to stifling at the thresh-hold an inquiry by the Court as to whether
the workmen are living in bondage and under inhuman conditions.","Even if the State Government is on its own inquiry satisfied that the workmen are not
bonded and are not compelled to provide forced labour and are living and working in decent
conditions with all the basic necessities of life provided to them, the State Government should not
baulk an inquiry by the court when a complaint is brought by a citizen, but it should be anxious to
satisfy the court and through the court the people of the country, that it is discharging its
constitutional obligation fairly and adequately and the workmen are being ensured social and
economic justice."
"These are the minimum requirements which must exist in
order to enable a person to live with human dignity and no State neither the Central Government
nor any State Government-has the right to take any action which will deprive a person of theBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 41enjoyment of these basic essentials.","This right to live with
human dignity, enshrined in Article 21 derives its life breath from the Directive Principles of State
Policy and particularly clauses (e) and (f) of Article 39 and Article 41 and 42 and at the least,
therefore, it must include protection of the health and strength of workers men and women, and of
the tender age of children against abuse, opportunities and facilities for children to develop in
healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity, educational facilities, just and humane
conditions of work and maternity relief.","Since the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in
clauses (e) and (f) of Article 39, Article 41 and 42 are not enforceable in a court of law, it may not be
possible to compel the State through the judicial process to make provision by statutory enactment
or executive fiat for ensuring these basic essentials which go to make up a life of human dignity but
where legislation is already enacted by the State providing these basic requirements to the workmen
and thus investing their right to live with basic human dignity, with concrete reality and content, the
State can certainly be obligated to ensure observance of such legislation for inaction on the part of
the State in securing implementation of such legislation would amount to denial of the right to live
with human dignity enshrined in Article 21, more so in the context of Article 256 which provides
that, the executive power of every State shall be so exercised as to ensure compliance with the laws
made by Parliament and any existing laws which apply in that State."
"We are so
much accustomed to the concepts of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence which require every legalBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 42proceeding including a proceeding for a high prerogative writ to be cast in a rigid or definitive mould
and insist on observance of certain well settled rules of procedure, that we implicitly assume that the
same sophisticated procedural rules must also govern a proceeding under Article 32 and the
Supreme Court cannot permit itself to be freed from the shackles of these rules even if that be
necessary for enforcement of a fundamental right.","Article 32 is so frequently used by lawyers and
Judges for enforcement of fundamental rights without any preliminary objection against its
invocation being raised on behalf of the State, that we have rarely any occasion to examine its
language and consider how large is the width and amplitude of its dimension and range.","It was on the basis of this impression fostered by
long association which the Anglo-Saxon system of administration of justice that for a number of
years this court had taken the view that it is only a person whose fundamental right is violated who
can approach the Supreme Court for relief under Article 32 or in other words, he must have a cause
of action for enforcement of his fundamental right."
"It is
clear on the plain language of clause (1) of Article 32 that whenever there is aBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 43violation of a fundamental right any one can move the Supreme Court for
enforcement of such fundamental right.","There is no limitation in the words of Clause (1) of Article 32 that the
fundamental right which is sought to be enforced by moving the Supreme Court
should be one belonging to the person who moves the Supreme Court nor does it say
that the Supreme Court should be moved only by a particular kind of proceeding.","Of course, the Court would not, in exercise of
its discretion, intervene at the instance of a meddlesome interloper or busy body and
would ordinarily insist that only a person whose fundamental right is violated should
be allowed to activise the court, but there is no fetter upon the power of the court to
entertain a proceeding initiated by any person other than the one whose fundamental
right is violated, though the court would not ordinarily entertain such a proceeding,
since the person whose fundamental right is violated can always approach the court
and if he does not wish to seek judicial redress by moving the court, why should some
one else be allowed to do so on his behalf."
"That is the reason
why it was held by this Court in the Judges Appointment and Transfer Case (supra) that where a
member of the public acting bona fide moves the Court for enforcement of a fundamental right on
behalf of a person or class of persons who on account of poverty or disability or socially or
economically disadvantaged position cannot approach the court for relief, such member of the
public may move the court even by just writing a letter, because it would not be right or fair to
expect a person acting pro bono publico to incur expenses out of his own pocket for going to a
lawyer and preparing a regular writ petition for being filed in court for enforcement of the
fundamental right of the poor and deprived sections of the community and in such a case, a letterBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 44addressed by him can legitimately be regarded as an ""appropriate"" proceeding.","The Constitution makers therefore advisedly provided in clause (1) of Article 32 that the
Supreme Court may be moved by any 'appropriate' proceeding, 'appropriate' not in terms of any
particular form but 'appropriate' with reference to the purpose of the proceeding.","But the question then arises as to what is the power which may be exercised by the Supreme Court
when it is moved by an ""appropriate"" proceeding for enforcement of a fundamental right."
"It is only because we have beenBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 45following the adversarial procedure for over a century owing to the introduction of the Anglo-Saxon
system of jurisprudence under the British Rule that it has become a part of our conscious as well as
sub-conscious thinking that every judicial proceeding must be cast in the mould of adversarial
procedure and that justice cannot be done unless the adversarial procedure is adopted.","In fact, there is no such constitutional compulsion enacted in
clause (2) of Article 32 or in any other part of the Constitution.","But it may be
noted that there is nothing sacrosanct about the adversarial procedure and in fact it is not followed
in many other countries where the civil system of law prevails."
"It is
true that the adoption of this non-traditional approach is not likely to find easy acceptance from theBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 46generality of lawyers because their minds are conditioned by constant association with the existing
system of administration of justice which has become ingrained in them as a result of long years of
familiarity and experience and become part of their mental make up and habit and they would
therefore always have an unconscious predilection for the prevailing system of administration of
justice.","And this is clearly permissible on the language of clause
(2) of Article 32 because the Constitution makers while enacting that clause have deliberately and
advisedly not used any words restricting the power of the court to adopt any procedure which it
considers appropriate in the circumstances of a given case for enforcing a fundamental right.","But if we want the fundamental rights to become a living reality and the Supreme Court to
become a real sentinel on the quivive, we must free ourselves from the shackles of outdated and
outmoded assumptions and bring to bear on the subject fresh outlook and original unconventional
thinking."
"The learned Additional Solicitor General and Mr. Phadke relied on Order XXVI of the
Code of Civil Procedure and Order XLVI of the Supreme Court Rules 1966 for the purpose of
contending that a commission can be appointed by the Supreme Court only for the purpose of
examining witnesses, making legal investigations and examining accounts and the Supreme CourtBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 47has no power to appoint a commission for making an inquiry or investigation into facts relating to a
complaint of violation of a fundamental right in a proceeding under Article 32.","To accept this contention would be to
introduce the adversarial procedure in a proceeding where in the given situation, it is totally
inapposite.","Now it is true that
Order XLVI of the Supreme Court Rules 1966 makes the provisions of Order XXVI of the Code of
Civil Procedure, except rules 13, 14, 19, 20, 21 and 22 applicable to the Supreme Court and days
down the procedure for an application for issue of a commission, but Order XXVI is not exhaustive
and does not detract from the inherent power of the Supreme Court to appoint a commission, if the
appointment of such commission is found necessary for the purpose of securing enforcement of a
fundamental right in exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction under Article 32."

meaning of Section 2(1)(a) is under an obligation to take necessary steps for the
purpose of securing compliance with these provisions by the thekedar or jamadar and
mine-lessees and owners of stone crushers."
"Now if the jamadar or thekedar in a stone quarry or stone crusher is a 'contractor' within

under-section 21 for payment of wages to each worker employed by him as contract labour and such
wages are to be disbursed in the presence of a representative duly authorised by the principal
employer.","There are elaborate Rules made under the Contract Labour Act called the Contract Labour
(Regulation and Abolition) Central Rules 1971 (hereinafter referred to as the Contract Labour Rules)

principal employer and licence to a contractor, but also particularise the details of the various
welfare and other facilities directed to be provided to the contract labour by Section 16, 17, 18 and 19
of the Contract Labour Act."
"We are not in a position at the present stage to
give a definite finding that what is stated in the Report of Dr. Patwardhan is true, but there can be
no doubt that whatever be the mode of payment followed by the mine lessees and stone crusher
owners, the workmen must get nothing less than the minimum wage for the job which is beingBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 56carried out by them and if they are required to carry out additionally any of the functions pertaining
to another job or occupation for which a separate minimum wage is prescribed, they must be paid a
proportionate part of such minimum wage in addition to the minimum wage payable to them for the
work primarily carried out by them.","It is also stated in the Report of Dr. Patwardhan that the workmen
employed in the stone quarries not only quarry the stone but also carry out the work of a shot firer
and a stone breaker, though the work of a shot firer cannot be done by them without proper training
as provided in the Mines Vocational Training Rules 1966 and for this work of a shot firer and a stone
breaker carried cut by them, they do not get the minimum wage stipulated for the occupation of a
shot firer or a stone breaker and moreover since they are piece-rated workers, their output falls
because of the other jobs they are required to carry out with the result that they are deprived of the
minimum wage which they should otherwise receive.","We would also suggest that the system of payment which is
being followed in the stone quarries and stone crushers, under which the expenses of the explosives
and of drilling holes are to be borne by the workmen out of their own wages, should be changed and
the explosives required for carrying out blasting should be supplied by the mine lessees or the
jamadar or thekedar without any deduction being made out of the wages of the workmen and the
work of drilling holes and shot firing should be entrusted only to those who have received the
requisite training under the Mines Vocational Training Rules 1966."

(b) where no such wage has been fixed in relation to any form of labour, the wages that are normally

commencement of the Act, every obligation of a bonded labourer to repay and bonded debt or such
part of any bonded debt as remains unsatisfied immediately before such commencement, shall be
deemed to have been extinguished.Bandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 58There are certain other consequential provisions in Section 7 to 9 but it is not necessary to refer to
them.","Section 5 invalidates any custom or tradition or any contract agreement or other instrument by
virtue of which any person or any member of the family or dependent of such person is required to
do any work or render any service as a bonded labourer.","Sections 10 to 12 impose a duty on every District Magistrate and every officer to whom power
may be delegated by him, to inquire whether, after the commencement of the Act, any bonded
labour system or any other form of forced labour is being enforced by or on behalf of, any person
resident within the local limits of his jurisdiction and if, as a result of such inquiry, any person is
found to be enforcing the bonded labour system or any other system of forced labour, he is required
forthwith to take the necessary action to eradicate the enforcement of such forced labour."
"It was not enough, contended
the learned Additional Solicitor General the petitioner merely to show that the workmen wereBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 59providing forced labour in that they were not allowed to leave the premises of the establishment, but
it was further necessary to show that they were working under the bonded labour system.","It was contended by the learned Additional Solicitor General on behalf of the State of Haryana that
in the stone quarries and stone crushers there might be forced labourers but they were not bonded
labourers within the meaning of that expression as used in the Act, since a labourer would be a
bonded labourer only if he has or is presumed to have incurred a bonded debt and there was nothing
in the present case to show that the workmen employed in the stone quarries and stone crushers
had incurred or could be presumed to have incurred any bonded debt.","The
learned Additional Solicitor General also submitted that in any event, even if the workmen filed
affidavits to the effect that they had taken advances from thekedar or jamadar and or mine lessees
and/or stone crusher owners and they were not allowed to leave the premises of the establishment
until the advances were paid of, that would not be enough evidence for the Court to hold that they
were bonded labourers, because the mine-lessees and stone crusher owners had no opportunity to
cross-examine the workmen making such affidavits."
"Now if this contention of the learned Additional Solicitor General were well-founded, it
would become almost impossible to enforce the provisions of the Bonded Labour System (Abolition)
Act 1976 because in every case where bonded labourers are sought to be identified for the purpose of
release and rehabilitation under the provisions of the Act, the State Authorities as also the employer
would be entitled to insist that the bonded labourers must first prove that they are providing forced
labour in consideration of an advance or other economic consideration received by them and then
only they would be eligible of the benefits provided under the Act and this would make it extremely
difficult, if not impossible, for the labourers to establish that they are bonded labourers because they
would have no evidence at all to prove that any advance or economic consideration was provided to
them by the employer and since employment of bonded labourers is a penal offence under the ActBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 60the employer would immediately, without any hesitation, disown having given any advance or
economic consideration to the bonded labourers.","It was on the basis of this
definitional requirement that the learned Additional Solicitor General on behalf of the State of
Haryana put forward the argument that even if the workmen employed in the stone quarries and
stone crushers were being compelled to provide forced labour, they were not bonded labourers,
since it as not shown by them or by the petitioner that they were doing so in consideration of an
advance or other economic consideration received from the mine-lessees and owners of stone
crushers.","It is indeed difficult to understand how the State
Government which is constitutionally mandated to bring about change in the life conditions of the
poor and the down-trodden and to ensure social justice to them, could possibly take up the stand
that the labourers must prove that they are made to provide forced labour in consideration of an
advance or other economic consideration received from the employer and are therefore bonded
labourers."
"We would therefore direct the Government of Haryana and also suggest to the other
State Governments, to take steps to sensitise the officers concerned with the implementation of theBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 61Act to this acute human problems and its socioeconomic parameters.","It is therefore necessary to impress upon the
administration that it does not help to ostrich-like bury its head in the sand and ignore the
prevalence of bonded labour, for it is not the existence of bonded labour that is a slur on the
administration but its failure to eradicate it and moreover not taking the necessary steps for the
purpose of wiping out this blot on the fair name of the State is a breach of its constitutional
obligation.","Moreover it may be noted that
the District Magistrates have a central role to play under the provisions of the Act and the State
Governments would therefore do well to instruct the District Magistrates to take up the work of
identification of bonded labour as one of their top priority tasks."

necessary to direct a further inquiry for the purpose of ascertaining whether any of the labourers

Central Government and the State of Haryana to ensure that the workmen receive no less than the
minimum wage and to facilitate this formula it would have to be provided that the expenses on
explosives and drilling holes shall be borne by the mine-lessees and or the jamadar or thekedar and
the work of drilling holes and shot firing shall be entrusted only to those who have received requisite
training under the Mines Vocational Training Rules 1966.","It may not be a matter
of any consequence as to which mode of payment is followed, whether the workmen are paid on
truck basis or on any other basis, but what is essential is and that is what the Minimum Wages Act
1948 requires that the workmen must not receive any wage less than the minimum wage.","We would direct the Central Government
and the State of Haryana to take the necessary steps in this behalf so that within the shortest
possible time and as far as possible within six weeks from today the workmen start actually receiving
in their hands a wage not less than the minimum wage."

shall also ensure that such claim is pursued vigorously and the amount of compensation awarded to
the workman is secured to him.","It is also necessary to point out that
whenever any workman suffers any injury or contracts any disease in the course of employment, he
is entitled to compensation under the Workmens' Compensation Act 1923, but unfortunately he is
very often not in a position to approach the appropriate court or authority for enforcing his claim to
compensation and even if he files such a claim, it takes a long time before such claim is disposed of
by the court or authority.","We would like to impress upon the Court or Authority before which
a claim for compensation is filed by or on behalf of the workman to dispose of such claim without

Government.","Where the Court embarks upon affirmative action in the attempt to remedy a
constitutional imbalance within the social order, few critics will find fault with it so
long as it confines itself to the scope of its legitimate authority.","For in most cases the jurisdiction of the Court is invoked when a default
occurs in executive administration, and sometimes where a void in community life
remains unfilled by legislative action."
"The example of similarBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 83cases in other countries can afford little support.","In most
cases of public interest litigation, there will be neither precedent nor settled practice
to add weight and force to the vitality of the Court's action.","The successful implementation of
the orders of the Court will depend upon the particular social forces in the backdrop
of local history, the prevailing economic pressures, the duration of the stages
involved in the implementation, the momentum of success from stage to stage, and
acceptance of the Court's action at all times by those involved in or affected by it."
"For that alone gives the decision ofBandhua Mukti Morcha vs Union Of India & Others on 16 December, 1983
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/595099/ 84the Court a direction which is certain, and unfaltering, and that particular permanence in legal
jurisprudence which makes it a base for the next step forward in the further progress of the law.","There is great merit in the Court proceeding to decide an issue on the basis of strict legal principle
and avoiding carefully the influence of purely emotional appeal.","Indeed, both certainty of substance and certainty of direction are indispensable requirements in the
development of the law, and invest it with the credibility which commands public confidence in its
legitimacy."

operation of the various statutes as well as the directions proposed by him.","The continued existence of such pockets of oppression and misery do no justice to the promises and
assurances extended by our Constitution to its citizens."
