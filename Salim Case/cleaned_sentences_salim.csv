the speed of the car is also one of the significant factors in the present case."
"so also
the route taken by the vehicle is also a significant factor. ravindra patil is the prosecution witness who mentioned that the car was being
driven at the speed of 90-100 km per hour. the factual position is that there were no break marks on the spot and there is no
mention in the spot panchnama to that effect."

which shall be dealt in detail while analyzing the argument of the learned public prosecutor in order
to ascertain whether the prosecution has reached that standard of proof required to establish the
guilt of the appellant for the offences charged and mainly the offence charged under section 304
part ii of ipc."
"52 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc
43. during the arguments, learned public prosecutor also submitted that the theory of the appellant
that one ashok singh was driving the vehicle can be negated in view of absence of any such case put
to any of the prosecution witnesses and more so when pw-7 fransis fernandez does not mention
regarding the presence of ashok singh on the spot. the defence evidence of dw-1 ashok singh was also assailed by the prosecution on various aspects
more particularly that dw-1 does not mention at which spot the left side front tyre of the car burst
when the car was on the hill road."

44. now having the broad analysis the substantive evidence before the sessions court vis-a-

acceptability and the trustworthiness of the witnesses is required to be done on the broad three
aspects as to who was driving, whether the appellant was drunk and whether it was E13 so
also the other allied submissions are also required to be dealt in detail."
"the post mortem report is exh.149/20. coming to the substantive
evidence of pw-2 muslim shaikh according to him the incident took place at about 2:45 a.m. and he
and other injured witnesses and deceased nurulla were sleeping near american laundry and he
heard a noise and found himself beneath the car. the wheel of the car passed over his left leg."
"he further stated that the people gathered were saying that salman khan got down from the
car. according to this witness one person also got down from the left side of the car saying that he
was a police. according to this witness, the people caught hold of the accused, but, subsequentlysalman salim khan vs the state of maharashtra on 10 december, 2015

apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc then the police appeared and brought him to bhabha hospital. it
is significant to note that this witness further stated that he was at bhabha hospital for a period of
two and half months and in the hospital he knew that nurulla had expired. thereafter according to
him bandra police recorded his statement."
"thereafter according to
him bandra police recorded his statement. again it is significant to note that at the end of his
examination-in-chief this witness has stated that he saw accused getting down from the right side of
the car. specifically he does not mention anything about the accused getting down from the car from
the front right or rear right."
"specifically he does not mention anything about the accused getting down from the car from
the front right or rear right. this substantive evidence of pw-2 was assailed on behalf of the
appellant/accused and it was brought on record that earlier this witness had stated before the
metropolitan magistrate court when his evidence was then recorded that he did not see anybody
getting down from the car. during the cross-
examination it has been brought on record that after 56 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc two
and half months he had gone to bandra and his only one statement was recorded."
"during the cross-
examination it has been brought on record that after 56 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc two
and half months he had gone to bandra and his only one statement was recorded. by pointing this
out, cross-examination appearing in para-3 of the notes of evidence in the paper book page pw-2/4
it is submitted on behalf of the appellant that this witness was not available to the police
immediately as according to him he had left bombay. his further cross-examination also revealed
that his statement was not shown to him by the police and he did not read the statement at any time."
"in the cross-examination it has been brought on record that the doctor asked him about the incident
but he was in pain and was not in a position to speak. according to this witness he returned to
mumbai on T41 from u.p. and prior to that he had not been to mumbai."
"moreover during his cross-
examination it is brought on record that before the metropolitan magistrate court he had not
mentioned that accused had got down from the car. as such by taking recourse to section 145 of the
evidence act, this witness was cross-examined on behalf of the defence during the trial before the
sessions court vis-
a-vis his earlier statement recorded before the m.m. court, bandra during the initial trial when the
offence was for section 304a of ipc."

right side may not be of much significance for the simple reason that this position of the appellant
coming out of the car from the driver's seat is accepted and it is so accepted while answering the
question under section 313 of cr.p.c.. though on this aspect the learned public prosecutor had
argued 59 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc that this answer is required to be taken against

is regarding defence placed before the court by way of factual position and admissions given by the
prosecution witnesses that the left side front door of the car was jammed and was not in a condition
to be opened. thus rendering even a person sitting by the left side of the driver to come out of the
vehicle from the driver's seat."
"47. now coming to the substantive evidence of pw-3 one mannu khan and who is apparently an 60
cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc important witness of the prosecution, it must be said that
said mannu khan had also sustained injuries to his left foot and there was a fracture to the proximal

american laundry. he suddenly heard a noise and found himself beneath the car."
"in the
substantive evidence in the chief he specifically mentioned that the accused got down from the
drivers seat and one bodyguard also got down from the said car. this witness also talked of a third
person who got 61 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc down from the back portion of the car. he
further stated that the bakery people caught hold of accused on the road."
"he
further stated that the bakery people caught hold of accused on the road. now the crucial evidence
of this witness in the chief which was vehemently assailed on behalf of the appellant, is to the effect
as follows :
""salman was so drunk that he fell down. salman khan stood but he again fell down and again he
stood and ran away from the spot."""
"48. according to the case of the prosecution, statement of this witness was recorded under section
164 of cr.p.c. on 5th october, 2002."
"it is his specific evidence in the cross-examination that the
police had shown one statement to bandra court and stated that it was his statement. according to
this witness, after perusing the said statement, magistrate asked him some questions and this
witness told as per the contents of the statement and thereafter his signature was obtained on thesalman salim khan vs the state of maharashtra on 10 december, 2015

language statement was recorded."
"all this material, which is
brought on record during his cross-
examination, goes to show that he was called by the police and before the magistrate he was
questioned and an earlier prepared statement was endorsed. the question remains, whether this
witness has given a truthful account either in his examination-in-chief or in his cross-examination. this is more so, as the crucial evidence in the examination-in-chief of this witness, as reproduced
earlier to the effect that the accused was drunk and fell twice and then ran away, is in fact an
omission and this omission has been brought on record during his cross-examination and
subsequently by asking to the officer."

"was recorded. if
still an allowance is required to be given to this witness, who 64 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc apparently, according to the prosecution is a rustic witness and
not an educated person, but still it is a factual position that there was a scope available to the
prosecution to counter check the truthfulness or otherwise of the answers given by this witness
during his cross-examination and this could have been done by examination of the concerned m.m. court."
"as such, a step was taken by the
prosecution to call the concerned magistrate before the court and to find out the truth or veracity in
the evidence of pw 3. on said application, apparently, no orders were passed by the trial court and
one constable mane was allowed to be called but he was also not examined as he was not available
and, therefore, the factual position remains that the substantive evidence of said pw 3, the major 65
cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc part of his testimony as to the falling down of the accused
twice and then running away is an omission and only after 12 years of the incident does the witness
give his testimony before the sessions court. at the cost of repetition, it must be mentioned that he was not examined before the m.m.court
when the main charge was under section 304-a of ipc."
"further, in the cross-examination, he has
answered and it is appearing in paragraph 7 in the notes of evidence that he could not move from
the place till the time the car was lifted. definitely, the circumstances after that incident were such
that all the injured and even deceased nurulla were under the said vehicle and it was the wee hours
of 2:45 a.m. in the morning and the injured witnesses could realise coming of the vehicle on their
persons only when the impact occurred and when they sustained injuries. during the arguments, the
learned public prosecutor submitted 66 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc that said pw 3 is, in
fact, a natural witness and had seen the incident and in fact also seen the accused driving the car."

fact, a natural witness and had seen the incident and in fact also seen the accused driving the car. in
order to substantiate his argument, the learned public prosecutor stated that said pw 3 was the
person who received minor injuries and he had all the opportunities to see how the incident had
occurred."
"in
order to substantiate his argument, the learned public prosecutor stated that said pw 3 was the

occurred. so far as injuries of this witness and their nature is concerned, the medical certificatesalman salim khan vs the state of maharashtra on 10 december, 2015
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148691067/ 22exh.150 is of much importance. it shows that this injured was referred to emergency operation and
his x-ray shows a fracture of proximal phalanx of greater toe, right side."
"much is argued on behalf of the state that 67 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc the degree of gravity of injury may differ and the fracture of a
proximal phalanx of a toe may not be that grievous or serious enough than the fracture of any other
bone of the body. for the time being, if it is accepted, still the other circumstances under which this
witness has sustained injury, cannot be over looked more so in the light of the major omission as
detailed earlier. 49."
"he has superficial infused
wound, which is skin deep and having length of 1.5 cm on the left hand and thumb and had minor
abrasion on right foot and right elbow. this witness has seen the 68 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc accused coming out of the car from the right side. he stated that
he signed the statement under section 164 of cr.p.c."
"according to him, many people were telling that accused got down from the car. also, according
to this witness, accused, then E15 after seeing the crowd. one police guard was
also present in the car."
"one police guard was
also present in the car. then, this witness was brought down to bhabha hospital for 69 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc treatment. again, it is significant to note that at the end of his
examination-in-chief again this witness mentions to the effect that ""the accused is the same person
who got down from the right side of the car""."

"at the cost of repetition, it can be mentioned that it is the own defence of the accused that he himself
came from the front side driver's seat in order to get out of the car after the incident. so the fact that
this witness told that the accused came out of the car from the right side is not of much significance,
when all these witnesses say that they saw the accused coming out of the car only after the incident
and not that anybody saw the accused actually driving the vehicle and bringing the said vehicle to
the spot. during the cross-
examination, this witness has stated that he signed on the statement under section 164 of cr.p.c."

"this reference is to the statement under section 164 of

during the cross-salman salim khan vs the state of maharashtra on 10 december, 2015
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148691067/ 23examination that he heard a big noise and was not knowing what had happened and his left hand
was stuck in the bumper of the vehicle and he was unable to make movement. he further answered
that due to darkness he was not knowing whether the vehicle climbed the stairs or not."
"he further answered
that due to darkness he was not knowing whether the vehicle climbed the stairs or not. the
cumulative effect of this witness goes to show that he sustained injuries and, apparently, he knew
that the accused came out of the car from the right side. in any event, this substantive evidence of
pw 4 may not be of much significance so far as the case of the prosecution is concerned as to driving
and that also under the influence of alcohol by the appellant."
"in any event, this substantive evidence of
pw 4 may not be of much significance so far as the case of the prosecution is concerned as to driving
and that also under the influence of alcohol by the appellant. however, during the
cross-examination still another admission is taken from this witness and this witness in paragraph 8
in his notes of evidence states to the following effect:
71 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc ""it did not happen that two persons ran away from the
car. the second person E15 after salman."
"50. by pointing out this admission, it is strongly argued on behalf of the appellant that this is the
witness who talked of four persons present in the said car during the incident and it is further
argued that the theory of four persons in the car is not later developed but it is put to the witnesses
and also to this witness pw 4. of course, this aspect of three persons or four persons in the car shall
be dealt in detail afterwards while dealing with the arguments advanced on behalf of the defence."
"51. now, the last injured witness examined is pw 11 mohd. abdulla."
"apart from
the fracture he had abrasion on the left forearm. again this witness gave the same account as to the
time and how the incident had occurred when he was sleeping along with other injured persons near
american laundry. according to him, at about 2:30 a.m. some heavy object had passed over his leg."
"bakery men and taxi driver rescued them by removing them from beneath the car. according
to this witness, bakery men and taxi driver were telling that accident was caused by the accused. he
had specifically answered that he had seen the accused only after he was rescued."
"with the accused but he does not know who 73 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc they were. this witness, due to his severe injuries, was
hospitalized in bhaba hospital for one and half month. though in the examination-in-chief this witness has stated that bakery men and taxi driver were
saying that accident was caused by the accused and though according to him, he stated to that effect
while recording his statement by the police, this part of his evidence is brought on record during his
cross-
examination as an omission and he could not assign any reason how that part of his evidence is not
appearing in his statement."

"52. the cumulative effect of these injured witnesses pw 2, 3, 4 and 11, as detailed above was referred
in the course of arguments on behalf of the appellant and it is submitted that definitely an attempt
has been made by the investigating agency through these witnesses to show that they had seen the
accused coming out of the car and then to presume that he was the person driving the car. placing
reliance on the testimonies of these witnesses, as mentioned in examination-in-chief, learned public

there cannot be a different view as to the importance of an injured witness, so far as how the injuries

course, this importance is heightened when the questions are regarding an assault and a fight
between the persons and under such circumstances the evidence of an injured person assumes
much importance."
"moreover, sustaining of an injury is also a fact leading to the conclusion that he
was one of the parties to the incident of assault. in the instant case, however, there is no dispute that
these witnesses sustained injuries in the incident, but the question is as to who was responsible. said
question cannot be answered by the factual position that they received injuries in this incident."
"54. apart from the above, it is brought to the notice of this court during the argument on behalf of
the appellant that there is inter se variance in the substantive evidence of these witnesses. pw 3
says, which is in fact an omission, that the accused was so drunk that he fell twice and then stood up
and ran away."
"however, pw 2 and 4 did not mention anything to that effect. in fact, out of these
four 77 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc witnesses except pw 3 nobody speaks about the
drunkenness of the appellant-accused much less his falling down on the spot twice and then running
away. 55."
"55. during the arguments, learned public prosecutor for the state stated that these witnesses do not
talk of four persons travelling in the car or coming out of the car after the incident. the learned
chief prosecutor wanted to suggest that non mentioning by these witnesses about four persons is
required to be taken as a mitigating circumstance to the defence of the accused."

"remaining silent may have two
implications, either he has seen but has not told and 78 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc
secondly that he had not seen at all. when a witness answers that he did not see four persons, then
there is more positive effect that the witness has seen only three persons and only three were
travelling. in any way, these witnesses remaining silent about how many persons were travelling in
the car, cannot be taken as a mitigating circumstance to the defence of the accused as argued on

"for that purposes the other material evidence is required to be dealt with

police guard i.e. ravindra patil and also kamal khan were doing during the incident."

consequences of a tainted investigation."

as depicted in the fir and as per the evidence of police guard ravindra patil."
"if the evidence of pw 3, the injured, is to be construed as to such heavy drinking and
falling twice on the spot by the appellant, then, definitely this aspect must not have been lost sight of
by ravindra patil while he gave his fir and this concept of alcohol which came in the investigation

"in view of the above, it cannot be said that the evidence of these injured pw 2, 3, 4 and 11 is
devoid of any discrepancies going to the root of the matter. moreover, the effect of their evidence
can be construed at the end after analyzing the entire evidence of the prosecution witnesses on the
different aspects which are required to be dealt in detail considering the arguments on behalf of the
appellant. 61."
"61. apart from the above injured witnesses, the substantive evidence of the other witnesses i.e. pw 8
ramasare pande and pw 12 kalpesh sarju verma is required to be examined concerning the aspect
of the 85 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc appellant driving the vehicle during the incident."
"as such the substantive evidence, recorded before the sessions court,
goes to show that according to him, he saw the accused getting down from the right front side of the
car and one police person was also present in the car and he told his name as patil. this is a witness
who is a resident on the first floor of pande dairy and his dairy is situated in the vicinity of scene of
the incident. so far as actual incident is concerned at about T18 when he heard a
big noise, he woke up and came down from the first floor."
"only significance of his
evidence is that he saw the accused getting down from the right side of the car and one police person
was also present there. however, it is still curious to note that this witness in fact in
examination-in-chief itself further went on to say the following:
""two persons were also present in the car in addition to salman and police constable
patil but i do not know who were those two persons."" 62."
"62. much reliance was placed by learned senior counsel on this answer of this witness in
examination-
87 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc in-chief. this is in consonance with the theory
propounded by the appellant that there were four persons in the car so as to probablize his defence
that his driver was there and who drove the car."
"now this pw 8 had given a story that he saw two more persons in the car in addition to the
accused and police guard patil. apparently, this answer in the examination-in-
chief itself is required to be construed and in the light of this answer the earlier answer of this
witness that he saw the accused getting down from the right front side of the car is to be critically
examined in the light of other material. it is accused's own defence that he got down from thesalman salim khan vs the state of maharashtra on 10 december, 2015
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148691067/ 28driver's side after the incident to come out of the car."
"as such the effect of the testimony of pw 8, in
fact, goes to show the probability of the 88 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc case of the
defence, argued on behalf of the appellant. on this argument, learned public prosecutor for the state stated that this answer of the witness pw
8 in his examination-in-chief is required to be construed, as an attempt by the defence to interfere
with the prosecution witnesses. without there being any other material to support this submission it
is difficult to accept this argument and only because the witness of the prosecution in

"but this has not been done by the prosecution. in fact, there is nothing brought before the court that
the 89 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc prosecution wants to disown this witness. then,
consequently, the evidence of this witness is required to be construed as per the plain meaning
which can be ascertained from his evidence."

"one more thing of significance, so far as the evidence of pw 8 is concerned, is required to be
mentioned. now, another answer is given by this witness in his cross-examination and the said
evidence is coming in paragraph no.4 of his notes of evidence at the end and it is to the following
effect:
""left front door of the car was so touched to the shutter to the american bakery, it
could not be opened and it was jammed in the shutter. people were trying to pull the
car and people were succeeded opening the right front side of the door."
"again, it must be mentioned that this answer 90 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc taken in
the cross-examination is probablizing the theory of the appellant-accused that the left side front
door of the car was jammed and so he could not come out of the car but came out from the front
right side door. even on this answer in the cross-examination the prosecution should have sought
further clarification from the witness on re-examination. but again he has not been disowned and
the said material remains on the record."
"but again he has not been disowned and
the said material remains on the record. not only this evidence but still at the end of paragraph 5 in
the cross-examination this witness has answered to the following effect:
""i do not know where two people sitting in the car, besides salman and police
constable patil, had gone."" 65."
"this is, in fact, the reiteration of the theory of the appellant of four persons present in the car
though this answer may not directly show that fourth person was the driver. but the answer does
mention that 91 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc according to this witness there were foursalman salim khan vs the state of maharashtra on 10 december, 2015
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148691067/ 29persons including the appellant and ravindra patil. apart from above, still one more answer in
paragraph 6 of his notes of evidence is to the effect :-
""the left front tyre of the car was found burst."""
"this is again the apparent defence of the appellant that the loss of control over the car was due to
bursting of left front tyre. even after this answer also there could have been remedial steps taken by
the prosecution to clarify the position or to disown the witness by putting him questions in the
nature of cross-examination saying that apparently he has been won over by the accused. but again
this has not been done and only during the arguments in the present appeal the learned public
prosecutor stated that the evidence of this witness so far as these answers given, 92 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc is required to be critically examined and not to be taken as a
help to the defence of the appellant."
"even after this answer also there could have been remedial steps taken by

apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc is required to be critically examined and not to be taken as a

"67. now coming to the substantive evidence of pw 7 again there is argument on behalf of the
prosecution that this witness is a partisan witness and in fact in stead of supporting the case of the
prosecution he has assisted the appellant-accused in propounding the theory of the defence. this is
the argument at this appellate stage and it is difficult to understand."
"this is
the argument at this appellate stage and it is difficult to understand. if it was the evidence of this
witness then why was he examined. apparently, he was examined for the reason that he was present
on the spot and there was some conversation between him and the accused to the following effect:
""salman recognized me and told me, commander save me""
68."
"apparently, he was examined for the reason that he was present
on the spot and there was some conversation between him and the accused to the following effect:
""salman recognized me and told me, commander save me""
68. earlier in examination-in-chief itself this 93 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc witness has
stated that at the time of the incident he was sleeping in his house and he knows the accused since
his childhood and the accused calls him by name ""commander"". after hearing the noise, he got up
and then came to the spot."
"he saw the accused surrounded by mob and one person was possessing rod in his hand, he
pulled that person back, also another person who was also having rod in his hand. at that time,
according to this witness, the accused recognized this witness from the mob and uttered the words
""commander save me"". the substantive evidence of this witness is required to be construed in the
natural way as he has told."
"at that time,
according to this witness, the accused recognized this witness from the mob and uttered the words
""commander save me"". the substantive evidence of this witness is required to be construed in the
natural way as he has told. his entire evidence does not suggest in any way either driving of the said
car by the appellant-accused or the appellant was drunk at the relevant time."
"when this was the

prosecutor, he tried to argue that the very words of the appellant-accused ""commander save me""
imply that the appellant-accused has done something wrong and in fact had committed something
objectionable so as to get himself freed from the clutches of the angry mob. in the considered view of
this court, this argument if to be accepted, then it would be a wild imagination and putting the view
of the prosecution in the mouth of the witness. 69."
"he further stated that the
accused was looking normal and was able to walk normally. this answer is required to be viewed in
juxtaposition of the substantive evidence of pw 3 injured witness as to the accused was so drunk, he
fell twice on the ground and then ran way. so also this evidence is to be viewed in the factual
position that the fir is silent about consumption of alcohol and the theory of alcohol comes only
after 1.10.2002."
"also this evidence is 96 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc required to be
viewed in juxtaposition of the other evidence of pw 9 rakhangi, the manger from the rain bar. evidence of that witness shall be critically examined later on when dealing with the allegations of
consumption of alcohol at the rain bar and collection of bills by the police during investigation. 70."
"70. again it is curious to note that even this witness is not disowned by the prosecution. in the
cross-examination though this witness has stated, as mentioned earlier, no questions were put to
this witness in the nature of cross-examination by the prosecution, more so when specific
substantive evidence of this witness in his last paragraph of the cross-examination shows to the
following effect:-
""there were 10 to 12 speed breakers on st andrews road in front of holy family
hospital at the relevant time."

""there were 10 to 12 speed breakers on st andrews road in front of holy family
hospital at the relevant time. at the relevant time road repairs in front of american
bakery and rubbles 97 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc were lying in front of
american bakery."""
"again this evidence is apparently supportive to the defence of the accused that there was bursting
of the tyre. moreover, the answer given by the witness as to 10 to 12 speed breakers on st. andrews
road has much significance than what it appears, for the reason that the case of the prosecution was
that the appellant was driving the car at the speed of 90 to 100 kilometers per hour and he had taken
the route to his home and come on the hill road from st. andrews road. it is admitted position that
st.andrews road is in front of the american bakery and there is holy family hospital."
"in any event, the cumulative effect of the substantive evidence of pw 7
does not further the case of the prosecution on any count, either on the driving the car or on the
consumption of alcohol. in spite of this situation, this witness is not disowned by the prosecution.salman salim khan vs the state of maharashtra on 10 december, 2015

"another factual position is brought to the notice of this court as apparent from
the substantive evidence of pw-20 dr. pawar. this witness agrees in the
cross-examination that as per the contents of form-
a and form-b, the two phials and said forms were kept in one sealed envelope. this witness talks of
single 143 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc sealed envelope containing form-a and form-b
and two phials of blood."

single 143 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc sealed envelope containing form-a and form-b
and two phials of blood. as against this the substantive evidence of the police head constable sharad
borade (pw-21) (no.2019) say that the investigating officer rajendra kadam (pw-26) called him
and gave two sealed envelopes and asked him to deliver them to the office of the ca."
"he also made noting on the letter to the following effect ""one sealed phial, seal intact as per
copy sent (blood in two phials)"". this witness talked of form b which is exh. 102. before the trial
court."
"it is significant to note that he talks of blood sample, in singular, though subsequently he
mentioned that while 147 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc writing his endorsement he had
mentioned in the bracket (blood in two phials). according to this witness, he affixed the two labels
which were found on the phials and put them on the form- ""b"" at the bottom. in fact, these are the
sticking plasters which were prepared according to pw no."
"20, giving the epr number, date and
time and pc number and also bear the signature of pw 20. according to this witness, pw 18, he
removed the labels from the blood bottle and affixed on the letter form- ""b"". thereafter, he kept the
blood phials in the refrigerator."
"thereafter, he kept the
blood phials in the refrigerator. further the evidence of this witness shows that T24 he
A10 he used the ""modified diffusion oxidation method"" for analyzing the
blood."
"then, it was apparently marked as p-19, which has now become exh.80
in the sessions court trial. the anomaly in the prosecution evidence does not stop here, but this witness pw 21 further went on
to say now during cross-examination that he brought back the form ""b"" which is exh.102 to the
police station and this happened on 30.9.2002. his evidence 155 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc to that effect reads thus :

buckle number was mentioned in the endorsement, (b.no."
"the usually used preservative even according to pw 18 and
according to the chemistry so far as analysis of blood for alcohol is sodium fluoride (naf). it is, in
fact, 165 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc astonishing to see that the expert witness pw 18
was not in a position to give correct chemical formula of sodium fluoride and he mentions the
formula as na 2 so4. na2so4 is actually 'sodium sulphate' and formulae for sodium fluoride is
'naf'."
"at the cost of
repetition, it must be mentioned that he received the sample from one constable. however, the
police constable pw 21 is silent on the aspect and he talked of giving sample to the receiving clerk.salman salim khan vs the state of maharashtra on 10 december, 2015
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148691067/ 52by pointing out this, it is submitted on behalf of the appellant that if it is required to be accepted
that both these witnesses are right on this aspect, then, some other constable must have reached the
ca with the sample because pw 21 was not the constable who gave the sample to pw 18. in fact, this
controversy could have been resolved by examining the receiving clerk from the office of ca but he
is not produced before the court in 170 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc order to establish the
link and to suggest that the constable pw 21 is not giving the correct evidence but he gave the
sample to pw 18 directly."
"118. again on the above aspect as to the drunkenness and testing of the blood of the appellant for
alcohol content, it is again significant to note that except dr pawar pw 20, no other witness of the
prosecution is saying that the accused was smelling of alcohol. even ravindra patil did not mention
this while giving his fir that the accused was drunk and drove the vehicle."
"this charge under section 66 (1)(b) of the bombay prohibition
act was already framed. then it so happened that after 17 witnesses the matter was again sent back
to the sessions court on committal. at this stage, the charge under section 66 (1)(b) was not framed."
"now, coming to the third major aspect as to whether it was a pure and simple
accident due to bursting of the left front side tyre of the car and whether the saidsalman salim khan vs the state of maharashtra on 10 december, 2015
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148691067/ 54defence raised on behalf of the
177 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc appellant-accused is probable or not. on this aspect, the
major substantive evidence is that of pw 19 arjun kesker, the rto inspector and also that of
defence witness ashok singh. pw 19 is the rto inspector who inspected the vehicle involved in the
accident and gave his report at exh.84."
"right side mirror was also found broken. now the specific observations of this witness are
coming in 178 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc paragraph no. 5 of his evidence before the
sessions court."
"apparently, the accident occurred at the junction of
st. andrews road and hill road. as such, considering installation of the speed breakers as stated by
the witnesses and considering the speed, alleged to be 90 to 100 km per hour, and considering the
damage which is now observed, it is difficult to assess as to whether the things had happened as
depicted by the case of the prosecution. the effect of a speed breaker can be understood by the
condition of the vehicle when running in at speed of 90 to 100 km per hour and if with this speed
the vehicle collides with any stationery object like in this case it collided with the shutter of
american laundry then the result of impact would be very disastrous so far as damage of the
vehicle."
"the effect of a speed breaker can be understood by the
condition of the vehicle when running in at speed of 90 to 100 km per hour and if with this speed
the vehicle collides with any stationery object like in this case it collided with the shutter of
american laundry then the result of impact would be very disastrous so far as damage of the
vehicle. this is more so when apparently there are no break marks on the spot and nothing to that
effect is appearing in the 180 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc panchnama, or there is no
evidence of any witnesses as to finding of break marks on the road or anything to suggest that the
vehicle may have slowed down. with this basic understanding, the evidence of pw 19 is to be analyzed."
"with this basic understanding, the evidence of pw 19 is to be analyzed. also it is to be seen in the
light of the evidence of the other witnesses as to the puncture or bursting of the left side front tyre. again, it is to be seen that this rto inspector pw 19 has not stated anything regarding the left side
door whether in damaged condition or inoperable in any manner."
"again, it is to be seen that this rto inspector pw 19 has not stated anything regarding the left side
door whether in damaged condition or inoperable in any manner. this witness further say that he
opened the driver's side door for checking the vehicle. he tried to start the engine by inserting the
key of the ignition."
"then, according to him, he took the vehicle for test drive. at this time, this witness
was questioned, still in the examination-in-
chief that instead of finding less air in the left front side wheel, whether he was in a position to drive
the car. to this he answered that he was in a position to drive the car in spite of the less air in the left
front tyre."
"to this he answered that he was in a position to drive the car in spite of the less air in the left
front tyre. at this juncture, it must be mentioned that there are various witnesses who deposed as to
finding the left front tyre either punctured or burst. without going much into details of the answers
by these witnesses, suffice it to say that pw 1 in para 7 stated ""left tyre of the car was found
punctured""."
"at this juncture, it must be mentioned that there are various witnesses who deposed as to
finding the left front tyre either punctured or burst. without going much into details of the answers
by these witnesses, suffice it to say that pw 1 in para 7 stated ""left tyre of the car was found
punctured"". pw 8 in para no."
"the
same police officer further stated that the left front tyre of the car was burst. the last prosecution
witness pw 27 police officer shengal stated to the following effect:-
""it was not possible for me to send the front left tyre to the forensic lab for
ascertaining the extent and cause of the burst."" 124."
"124. by the above, this witness accepted that the tyre was burst but he did not take any measures to
find out the cause, much less to ascertain whether it was due to the impact of the incident or because
of the bursting the incident occurred i.e. whether it is the final result of the incident occurred, or it is
the cause for the incident."""
"now coming back to the evidence of pw 19, 183 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc during
the course of cross-examination he had given altogether a different story as to on which day he
examined the vehicle and which day he gave the report at exh.84. according to this witness, he
came to know about the incident when he received the call on 29.9.2002. he enquired with the
police about the incident but they could not tell him about the incident."
"he further stated that he did not
see the case papers. now, a very different story is given by this witness during cross-examination
which is appearing in paragraph 12 of his notes of evidence to the following effect:
184 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc ""it is true that i came to know that on the morning of
T11 that E13 had occurred. i also made a call to the control room on 29.9.2002 as to
whether an inspection of the vehicle involved in the accident is to be carried or not."
"he
was inspector working with him and was senior to him. according to this witness, imtiyaz also
accompanied to bandra police station. imtiyaz came with him as he was residing near bandra police
station."
"imtiyaz came with him as he was residing near bandra police
station. according to this witness, it happened on T11 at about 9:00 to T31 this witness
further answered that the officer who gave him the key for inspection of that vehicle was standing
with imtiaz and imtiaz had also seen the vehicle."
"according to this witness, it happened on T11 at about 9:00 to T31 this witness
further answered that the officer who gave him the key for inspection of that vehicle was standing
with imtiaz and imtiaz had also seen the vehicle. according 185 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc to this witness, imtiaz told him whether he checked a particular
thing in the vehicle or not."
"this witness
further answered that the officer who gave him the key for inspection of that vehicle was standing
with imtiaz and imtiaz had also seen the vehicle. according 185 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc to this witness, imtiaz told him whether he checked a particular
thing in the vehicle or not. this witness returned the key to the officer within 20 minutes from the
moment key was given to him."
"according 185 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc to this witness, imtiaz told him whether he checked a particular
thing in the vehicle or not. this witness returned the key to the officer within 20 minutes from the
moment key was given to him. on the next day of this inspection he visited bandra police station at
about 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. and remained there for half an hour."
"in fact, this is totally in variance to his earlier story given in paragraph no.3 in his
examination-in-chief that he inspected the vehicle at T31 on 29.9.2002. admittedly, this
witness has not been declared hostile and is not put the questions in the nature of cross-examination
by the learned prosecutor during the trial. the variance in the substantive evidence of this witness
has not been explained by the prosecution by taking answers from him."
"admittedly, this
witness has not been declared hostile and is not put the questions in the nature of cross-examination
by the learned prosecutor during the trial. the variance in the substantive evidence of this witness
has not been explained by the prosecution by taking answers from him. as such this witness was
also not disowned by the prosecution."
"the variance in the substantive evidence of this witness
has not been explained by the prosecution by taking answers from him. as such this witness was
also not disowned by the prosecution. this raises a reasonable doubt whether in fact the 186 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc
inspection of the vehicle was done by him as stated."
"more so by driving the vehicle when it was admittedly immobilized and was required to have been
taken from the spot of the incident to the police station by towing. considering these circumstances
and the evidence of the other witnesses mentioned above, it is difficult to accept that the left side
front tyre of the vehicle was not punctured or burst. now the question remains whether the bursting
of the tyre was prior to the incident or it was the bursting due to the impact of the car on the
platform in front of the american bakery."
"th        th
             dictation on 9    and 10
                                        december, 2015:
127. in view of the above observations it is ascertained that the vehicle involved in the accident had a
punctured / burst tyre and in fact this position has been depicted by various witnesses as discussed
in 187 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc detail above. though on this count the substantive
evidence of pw-19 and also the documentary evidence of vehicle examination report states
otherwise, it must be said that the report (exhibit-84) apparently is not in the form prescribed for
the road traffic accident report."
"in this context the defence of the accused is required to be seen. needless to mention
that in a criminal trial it is the duty of the prosecution to establish its own case and there is no
obligation by law on the accused to prove his innocence and even if he chooses to record any defence
witness then the burden of establishing the defence can be discharged by the material which need
not be satisfying the test of evidence beyond reasonable doubt. it is well settled 189 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc that the defence can establish its case if at all the defence
chooses to, by way of giving evidence which satisfy the standard of preponderance of probability."
"it is well settled 189 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc that the defence can establish its case if at all the defence
chooses to, by way of giving evidence which satisfy the standard of preponderance of probability. in
fact with this understanding the entire evidence of defence witness dw-1 ashok singh is required to
be viewed. in paragraph-3 a specific case is pleaded by dw-1 and which is reproduced hereunder :
""i then took the vehicle on linking road, then on gonsalves road and took the right
turn for going to hill road."
"now the important aspect of the matter is required to be dealt with and that is
the acceptability of the evidence of ravindra patil under section 33 of the evidence
act. in fact this is the crucial aspect as apart from this testimony of ravindra patil,
the
195 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc prosecution case rests only on the substantive evidence
of the injured eye witnesses concerning the driving of the vehicle and eye witnesses from the rain
bar on the aspect of drunkenness. as such, the substantive evidence of ravindra patil is of utmost
importance and in fact he is the first informant in the matter as he lodged his complaint within two
hours of occurrence of the incident."
"the situation for taking recourse to section 33 of the evidence
act occurred because of the specific circumstances in the present case. as detailed earlier in the
beginning of this judgment, the matter was before the metropolitan magistrate court and 17
prosecution witnesses were examined. ravindra patil was in fact pw-1 as he is the first informant,
admittedly when the main charge was for the offence under section 304a of ipc."
"firstly the provisions of section 33 of the evidence act can be seen which reads thus :
""33. relevancy of certain evidence for proving, in subsequent proceeding, the truth of
facts therein stated.-- evidence given by a witness in a judicial proceeding, or before
any person authorized by law to take it, is relevant for the purpose of proving, in a
subsequent judicial proceeding, or in a later stage of the same judicial proceeding, the
truth of the facts which it states, when the witness is dead or cannot be found, or is
incapable of giving evidence, or is kept out of the way by the adverse party, or if his
presence cannot be obtained without an amount of delay or expense which, under the
circumstances of the case, the court considers unreasonable:
provided--
that the proceeding was between the same parties or their representatives in interest;
197 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc that the adverse party in the first
proceeding had the right and opportunity to cross-examine;
that the questions in issue were substantially the same in the first as in the second proceeding. explanation.--a criminal trial or inquiry shall be deemed to be a proceeding between the prosecutor
and the accused within the meaning of this section."

"court could be taken as an evidence and the sessions case
can proceed on this. earlier in the preliminary paragraphs of this judgment this aspect has been
dealt in detail as to in what manner the sessions court directed the denovo trial thus not accepting
the evidence of all 17 prosecution witnesses. if by operation of law and by committal proceedings the
earlier evidence recorded before the metropolitan magistrate court cannot be considered as a valid
evidence to establish the case against the accused, then it is difficult to accept that how part of that
evidence can be accepted under different provision if the mandate of section 33 of the evidence act
is not fully complied."
"moreover it is 205 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc significant to note
that said ravindra patil died on 3.10.2007 and prior to that he was examined before the
metropolitan magistrate court. the last witness before the metropolitan magistrate court was
examined on or about 25.2.2011 i.e. witness no.17."
"the last witness before the metropolitan magistrate court was
examined on or about 25.2.2011 i.e. witness no.17. in fact much prior to the year 2011, ravindra patil had already expired."
"in fact much prior to the year 2011, ravindra patil had already expired. however admittedly this
position was not brought to the notice of the sessions court when the sessions trial commenced and
almost 24 prosecution witnesses were examined. still it is pertinent to note in the present sessions
case that the usual procedure of recording of the evidence has not been followed."
"still it is pertinent to note in the present sessions
case that the usual procedure of recording of the evidence has not been followed. of course, there
cannot be any straight jacket formula as to examination of witnesses in a particular manner but
when the witness is a first informant and when the entire case of prosecution rests on his evidence
then it is the first thing for the prosecution to bring him before the court if available 206 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc and then to proceed further with the matter, more so when it is
sessions trial. in fact ravindra patil was then a constable working in the bombay police force and
at some point of time he was dismissed from service and was not available before metropolitan
magistrate court for giving evidence after his earlier evidence was recorded."
"subsequently his brother pw-25 kailas was examined by the prosecution on 7.3.2015 and through
him the death certificate (exhibit-140) of ravindra patil was produced on record. it is also pertinent
to note that even till recording of 24 witnesses before the sessions court, not for a single time did
the sessions court enquire as to the whereabouts of the first informant and why so far he was not
examined. if the death of ravindra patil was not known to the police and also 207 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc to the court then the first endeavour to be made by the
prosecution was to examine ravindra patil or to search for him and then report to the court his
unavailability due to his death."
"the
application for taking his evidence on record under section 33 of the evidence act was filed by the
prosecution (below exhibit-131). it may not be of specific importance but the timing of said
application (exhibit-131), by the prosecution for taking evidence of ravindra patil on record in the
sessions court, is crucial i.e after recording of evidence of 24 witnesses although ravindra patil was
named as the first witness in the witness list. the appellant/accused filed his reply vide exhibit-136

adopted by the sessions court contending that had the decision of admissibility decided at the very
threshold of the sessions case and although not at the starting of the trial, but even at the time of
passing the orders on exhibit-131, then also there would have been an opportunity for the
appellant/accused to take an appropriate stand and either to re-call earlier witnesses and to take
appropriate steps for putting forth the defence. however, this opportunity was lost because of the
adjudication by the sessions court at the time of final judgment, accepting the admissibility of the
evidence and relying on the same that also for the purpose of decision on the main charge of section

recorded was at the time of the main charge under section 304a of ipc before the magistrate court."

""where it is desired to have recourse to this section on the ground that a witness is

then has the opportunity of seeing the witness and observing his demeanour and can
thus form a better opinion as to his reliability than is possible from reading a

statutory provision that this can be achieved."

"ravindra patil's evidence was recorded before 220 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc the
metropolitan magistrate court specifically on 5.1.2006, T33 and 6.6.2006. thereafter the
matter was adjourned to 7.2.2006 when the witness was under cross-examination. subsequently it
so happened that he did not remain present before the court and apparently nbw was directed to
be issued against him and he was taken in custody and then his evidence was lastly recorded on
T35 and he was re-examined by the learned prosecutor."
"subsequently it
so happened that he did not remain present before the court and apparently nbw was directed to
be issued against him and he was taken in custody and then his evidence was lastly recorded on
T35 and he was re-examined by the learned prosecutor. on T11 according to this
witness he was attached to protection branch and was deputed as bodyguard for the accused. he
joined his duty at about 8:00 p.m. on 27.9.2002."
"according to the further substantive evidence of ravindra patil, the accused was
drunk and was driving his motor car at a speed of 90 - 100 km per hour. according to this witness
before coming to the junction of hill road he told the accused to lower the speed of the motor car as
the right turn was ahead. again according to this witness, the accused neglected him."
"according to this witness
before coming to the junction of hill road he told the accused to lower the speed of the motor car as
the right turn was ahead. again according to this witness, the accused neglected him. the accused
could not control the motor car while taking the right turn and went on the foot path."
"there were shouts of the people
and as such people gathered there. further this witness stated that due to the incident, the people
who had gathered there became 223 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc furious and they started
manhandling the inmates of the car. said ravindra patil disclosed his identity as a police officer and
thus pacified the mob."
"then ravindra patil showed the place of incident to the police and then went to bandra
police station to lodge the complaint. according to this witness the incident had taken place due to
high speed and the accused was drunk and was driving and could not control the vehicle while
taking the turn. the fir was marked as 224 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc exhibit-p1
before the metropolitan magistrate court and it was so taken on record in the sessions case also."
"145. by pointing out the above substantive evidence of ravindra patil it is submitted on behalf of
227 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc the appellant that if the speed of the car as depicted by
the witness is taken as 90 to 100 kms per hour then the distance of maximum 8 kms can be covered
by 7 to 8 minutes. if still giving some allowance as to the exact speed whether correctly mentioned
or not and allowance to the exact distance between j.w marriot and the place of the incident, still it
is difficult to perceive that a car will take half an hour to reach the spot of incident."
"if still giving some allowance as to the exact speed whether correctly mentioned
or not and allowance to the exact distance between j.w marriot and the place of the incident, still it
is difficult to perceive that a car will take half an hour to reach the spot of incident. if the timings are
accepted and in fact are required to be accepted because of the documentary evidence then the car
had taken 30 minutes non stop from jw marriott hotel to the place of the incident and that is the
distance of about 7 to 8 kms., so definitely it can be ascertained that the speed of the car was not as
told by the witness as 90 to 100 kms per hour. at the cost of repetition it must be mentioned that
even this aspect has been dealt with earlier when the damage to the car was ascertained 228 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc vis-a-vis the speed of the car and mentioning of pw-7 that there
were speed beakers on st. andrews road."
"146. apart from the above there is another strange factual position which is required to be
mentioned inasmuch as after giving evidence before the metropolitan magistrate court on T32
and when the witness answered that his further statement was recorded by the police on 1.10.2002,
a question was put by the learned prosecutor to the witness to the effect :
""what did you say before the police? ""salman salim khan vs the state of maharashtra on 10 december, 2015
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148691067/ 69147."
"however
apparently said question was allowed by the trial court by giving a reason that the question is not a
leading one. it must be mentioned that whatever a witness states before the police is hit by section
161 of 229 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc cr.p.c. and only that statement can be considered
as provided under section 162 of cr.p.c.."
"in fact with that understanding of the basic criminal law
the defence counsel has raised the objection but unfortunately that has been overruled by the
sessions court as the sessions court lost sight of this situation as to the statement before the police
and the significance of it. so it could not have gone on record what a witness stated to the police but
the learned judge took it as not a leading question and then allowed the answer. still the strange
situation does not stop there."
"still the strange
situation does not stop there. after allowance by the sessions court the witness answered that :
""i have stated before the police what i remembered after the lodging the complaint
with bandra police."" 148."
"in fact for the first time before the metropolitan magistrate court apparently the name of said
ashok singh has appeared when ravindra patil gave his answer to the question as to what he
remembered after filing of the complaint. again apparently that time there was no answer coming
from the witness possibly regarding drunkenness though it was the case of the prosecution. even
231 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc thereafter, the episode of question and answer
continued and the learned prosecutor went on asking questions as to what the witness said next but
the witness also gave answers and talked of something else but not about the 'drunkenness'."

answer of the witness prior to the prosecutor asking permission to put the leading question to this
witness, was to the question 'whether you stated anything more' and then the answer was 'nothing

to the following effect :
""heard spl."
"p.p. according to him, such question can be put when the witness has not
supported on material point and before declaring him hostile after taking his answer. (considering both the sides, i am of the opinion that such leading question can be
asked with the permission of the court."
"even still the leading questions were asked. the last answer of this witness was that ""my supplementary statement was recorded
as per my say."" 151."
"151. by pointing out the above conduct of the witness ravindra patil it is strongly submitted on
behalf of the appellant that it is in fact an unnatural conduct on the part of ravindra patil to say so,
mentioning the things which he did not mention while giving his first information report or while
giving his supplementary statement. this witness has improved on the material aspect firstly as to
the 'drunkenness' of the accused and secondly as to this witness cautioning the accused to drive

road to st. andrews road while coming to the hill road, non mentioning about drunkenness of thesalman salim khan vs the state of maharashtra on 10 december, 2015
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148691067/ 71appellant in the first information report and the story of drunkenness coming only T24
and in fact on the same day receipt of the report from ca and mainly considering that the
cross-examination of ravindra patil was only before the metropolitan magistrates court and when
the charge was under
section 304a of ipc, it is to be held that the evidence of ravindra patil is of very
weak type. though subject to the argument as to applicability or otherwise of section
33 of the evidence act, his evidence is to be 236 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc accepted on the factum of driving of the vehicle
then considering the type of this witness, an independent corroboration is required to
support what he stated before the metropolitan magistrate court. 154."
"154. needless to mention that in criminal trials when a particular fact is established before the court
through ocular evidence there are three types of witnesses. as endorsed by the apex court in

and (3) wholly unreliable witness."

the attempt of everybody to avoid any allegations of criminal act and not to get oneself involved in it
of his own. by pointing out this it is submitted on behalf of the appellant that in fact though it is an

for saying that he was driving the vehicle and not the accused. the substantive
evidence of this witness goes to show that he was a driver in the employment of father
of the appellant and since 1990 he was working with salim khan, the father of the

some foul play and police then took the accused by arresting him. 159."

indicates that when he arrived at the jw marriott hotel he saw the accused sitting on the driver seat

"the criminal
procedure is otherwise and it is required to be honored and followed. as such argument leveled by
248 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc the state that the witness is coming at the fag end
cannot be accepted as an argument of substance, more so when the defence is not at all to establish
his case and if at all to putforth any evidence i.e. to be only to the extent of acceptance under
preponderance of probabilities."
"lastly on this point it is argued on behalf of the state that if not before the court for giving the
evidence but at least a person could have approached some other institutions. by this argument
learned prosecutor presupposes that this defence witness should have gone to the media. in each
and every circumstance and situation everybody is not expected to rush to the media though in the
recent years the media is considered as a fourth pillar of the constitution."
"much responsibility is on
the media and when a person approaches the media then apparently 249 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc an impression is created in the mind of general public that
whatever he is telling is having some ring of truth and the matter is required to be taken to task by
the appropriate agencies. without commenting much on this, suffice it to say that not going to any
external authorities than the court of law, cannot be considered as a deficiency when the witness is
coming before the court at an appropriate stage to mention what had happened. in that event his
evidence is to be appreciated with rather care with the principle that his evidence is to be accepted
on the touchstone of preponderance of probabilities."
"here it is not a question of believing or 250 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc disbelieving
a defence given, but here the question is whether the prosecution has established its case as to
driving by the appellant/accused that also drunken driving. as such, with the above observations it
must be said that the evidence of defence witness is to be viewed with such caution and to see
whether on those probabilities putforth by the defence witness whether the prosecution has
established its case beyond reasonable doubt. non-examination of kamal khan :salman salim khan vs the state of maharashtra on 10 december, 2015

"court from the earlier proceeding. as such, during the
arguments of this appeal at the fag end an application was preferred on behalf of the appellant for
examining said kamal khan as a court witness under provisions of section 391 of cr.p.c. said
application was preferred on 16.11.2015 at the conclusion of defence arguments."
"it remained
pending for few dates as by that time the arguments on behalf of the state were started and in
progress. detailed reply was filed by the state opposing the 253 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc
application by submitting the main contention that it is not necessary to call kamal khan for the
evidence as a court witness. it was also specifically mentioned in the reply that various steps were
taken when the matter was pending before the m.m."
"said application was dealt with by this court and a detailed order is passed on
30.11.2015. this court held that considering the purport of section 391 of cr.p.c., it is not a dire
need for examination of kamal khan as a court witness in order to assist the court to come to a just
decision. at that juncture, there was no question of drawing adverse inference for non-examination
of kamal khan 255 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc as argued by the state and in fact that
aspect was kept pending till the final adjudication of the appeal and as such under this premise the
present aspect is being dealt with as during the course of arguments, learned senior counsel for the
appellant vehemently submitted that on non-examination of kamal khan by the prosecution,
adverse inference is required to be drawn."
"as such it be treated as mitigating circumstance to the
case of the prosecution. though at the time of deciding the application under section 391 of cr.p.c.,
this court held it not necessary to call kamal khan as a court witness, now at this stage an inference
is required to be drawn further argued. considering the manner in which the prosecution has taken
steps to bring kamal khan before the trial court for recording of his evidence."
"this is more so, when the evidence of ravindra patil was to
be critically discussed and having less evidential value because of no opportunity of
cross-examination in sessions court. examination of an eye-witness and when the case is on a very limited number of eye-witnesses, as in
the present case, according to the prosecution of two witnesses, non-examination of one of the eye-
witnesses is definitely detrimental to the case of the prosecution, if otherwise the prosecution is not
coming with a stand that the said witness has been won over and definitely not available in spite of
due diligence to secure his presence. 166."
"this conduct on the part of the investigating agency leads to the
conclusion that the 259 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc investigation was not desirous of
bringing kamal khan before the court for giving evidence. whatever might be the reason for not
bringing him before the court, the fact remains that he was one of the eye-witnesses to the incident
and should have thrown light on the factual circumstances and more so when the defence of the
appellant-accused was spelt out much earlier as to driving of the vehicle by the fourth person by
name ashok singh. even apparently, the name of ashok singh has already appeared in the record
when the matter was before the m.m."
"16 mumbai is attached. this letter is the report of outcome
of the summons issued against the witnesses including kamal khan. name of kamal khan is
mentioned at serial no.3 in these witnesses."
"this letter is the report of outcome
of the summons issued against the witnesses including kamal khan. name of kamal khan is
mentioned at serial no.3 in these witnesses. what was pointed out on behalf of the
appellant-accused by the learned senior counsel was that apparently this report is not forming part
of the court record of the sessions case."
"definitely, the process was not issued at the known address ofsalman salim khan vs the state of maharashtra on 10 december, 2015
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148691067/ 78kamal khan and an attempt was made to serve him on the address 262 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc of 2002. apparently, for certain purpose this witness was
withheld by the prosecution and as such in the considered view of this court a necessary adverse
inference is required to be drawn against the prosecution for non-examination of kamal khan as a
prosecution witness. coming back to the application under section 391 of cr.p.c., the same was filed
by the appellant-accused at the fag end of the present appeal."
"taking an over all view, this
court rejected the said application on 30/11/2015 on the grounds contained in the said order and
more particularly that on the basis of already available material it was not a case where a just verdict
would not be possible unless kamal khan is examined. power under section 391 is not to be invoked
casually and the refusal thereof does not preclude the court from drawing adverse inference, on the
basis that such 263 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc witness was not examined during trial
despite ample opportunity. though, it is so, independently also the case of the prosecution is being
analyzed and is being appropriately dealt with keeping aside this aspect of adverse inference on the
non-examination of kamal khan."
"that was a case in which the spot
panchnama was duly proved by pw 11 and 16. there is nothing in the cross-examination of these
witnesses to doubt their presence or veracity. the long brake marks in curve show that the vehicle
was being driven by the appellant at high speed; the appellant had lost control of the speeding
vehicle resulting in the accident and, consequently, seven deaths and injury to eight persons."
"again in the considered view of this court, ratios in alister pareira's case and sanjeev nanda's
case are to be construed in the light of specific facts of those cases.salman salim khan vs the state of maharashtra on 10 december, 2015

factual position and the presence or otherwise of the footpath at the scene of offence and the

made prior to disposing of the appeal;
183. pw 1 is the panch witness, one sambha gauda he was running a tea stall near one temple at st.
andrews road, bandra. at about 3:00 a.m. he was called on the spot on T11 by bandra police
and was informed that one car was involved in the accident and to act as pancha."
"further,
he answered that it did not happen that the police entered in the car by opening the door of the car
for inspection and that police found rc book, certified copy of new india assurance and police took
possession of these documents and key of the car. this witness denied the police having done so and
also when confronted with the portion mark ""a"" from the panchnama he stated that it was not
correctly recorded. he further stated that he had not measured the spot personally and that police
had done the 282 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc marking in his presence."
"184. apart from the above, it is also brought to the notice of this court that another pancha,
according to this witness and according to the panchnama exh.28 is by name arjun and his address
is given as antop hill, sion koliwada. 185."
"284 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc
186. after analysis of the substantive evidence of pw 1 panch witness sambha gauda, now a
reference is required to be made regarding the arguments as to the topography of the area where the
incident had occurred and also whether there was a cement platform in front of the american
bakery and whether there were any steps i.e. sort of stair-case and whether there was a footpath."
"site map is at
exh.143 before the sessions court and it was prepared by the officer, when, in fact, the vehicle was
not on the spot and it was already removed to bandra police station. there is variance in the
substantive evidence of the prosecution witnesses and mainly of the injured persons and also of the
police officer. pw 3 stated that the right front side tyre was resting on the ota (platform)."
"according to the police officer pw 26, vehicle land cruiser had climbed three stairs and
the right front wheel was resting on the 286 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc stairs of the
laundry. in fact, what is depicted in the site map exh.143 is not what is appearing from the
substantive evidence of these witnesses. moreover, in fact, it is also not in consonance with what is
stated by ravindra patil that the car had gone inside the shop to the extent of 3â½ feet thereby
puncturing the shutter of the laundry."
"the answer was ""i have stated so"". further there
was a question as to whether this witness has stated to the reporter of mid-day that salmankhan i.e. the accused was driving the motor car at the speed of 70 km per hour."
"the accused was driving the motor car at the speed of 70 km per hour. to this question witness
answered, ""i do not remember"". by pointing to these questions and answers, it is submitted on
behalf of the appellant-salman salim khan vs the state of maharashtra on 10 december, 2015
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148691067/ 85accused that this witness has conveniently answered to the question that he does not remember and
those answers are to the questions as to the driving by altaf and speed of the car was 70 km per hour
when it was 288 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc driven from jw marriott hotel back to

that in the valet parking of jw marriott hotel car was halted, the accused sat on driver's seat and
the witness answered in the affirmative."

the witness answered in the affirmative. by pointing this out, it is submitted that the answers ""i do

actually happen or not."
"of course, this argument was strongly objected by the learned public
prosecutor on various counts, firstly it is submitted that the reporter of the mid-day is not brought
before the court to establish the factum that there was, in fact, interview taken and taken in a
particular manner contending the circumstances which were put to ravindra patil during his
cross-examination. in 289 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc fact, as per section 145 of the
evidence act if at all the witness is to be contradicted then only the said earlier statement of the
witness is required to be shown to him. otherwise, the witness can be asked questions on his earlier
statement."
"in 289 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc fact, as per section 145 of the
evidence act if at all the witness is to be contradicted then only the said earlier statement of the
witness is required to be shown to him. otherwise, the witness can be asked questions on his earlier
statement. as such, considering this legal position and considering the answers given by ravindra
patil and acceptance by him that he did give interview to the mid-day on 29.9.2002, in the opinion
of this court, though what is argued on this aspect cannot be accepted on behalf of the
appellant-accused but still the conduct of ravindra patil can be seen by way of the answers given."
"now, the last argument advanced on behalf of the appellant-accused is that death of nurulla
was not 290 cr apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc due to the accident or due to the driving of the
vehicle. during the arguments, it is submitted that there is substantive evidence of witnesses to
show that the crane was brought on the spot to lift the vehicle which was immobilized and also had a
burst left front tyre. it is an admitted position that crane was called to lift the vehicle and place it
aside so that the injured beneath the vehicle could be removed."
"on this aspect, it is
submitted on behalf of the appellant that after the incident a mob of many people hadsalman salim khan vs the state of maharashtra on 10 december, 2015
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148691067/ 88gathered and the mob was in aggressive mood and some of the members were also
armed with rods and other articles. even according to the witnesses and also the
injured who had been on the spot, the mob was furious and in fact there could have
been a law and order problem and it in fact happened as the mob had spotted the
appellant-accused coming out of the vehicle and the vehicle had caused death of one
person and injuries to other four persons. as such considering this argument and the
factual position that the circumstances were such that in order to escape from the
fury of the mob and these circumstances were beyond the control of the 297 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc appellant, no such appropriate steps were taken
to secure the medical aid to the injured persons."
"the benefit of every reasonable doubt which arises out of the
evidence adduced, must necessarily be given in favour of the 301 cr
apeal-572-2015-judgment.doc accused. in this case, considering the various
weaknesses in the case of the prosecution, various shortcomings such as
non-examination of necessary and appropriate witnesses, the omissions and
contradictions in the evidence of the injured witnesses which go to the root of the
matter, definitely a doubt has arisen as to the involvement of the appellant for the
offences with which he is charged. on the basis of this type of evidence the appellant
cannot be convicted though the apparent perception might be different as appearing
in the mind of a common man."
