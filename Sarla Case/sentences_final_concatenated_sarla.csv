"It is the foundation of the family and in turn of the society without which
no civilisation can exist. Till the time we achieve the goal - uniform civil code for all the citizens of India -
there is an open inducement to a Hindu husband, who wants to enter into second
marriage while the first marriage is subsisting, to become a Muslim. Since monogamy
is the law for Hindus and the Muslim law permits as many as four wives in India,
errand Hindu husband embraces Islam to circumvent the provisions of the Hindu
law and to escape from penal consequences."
"Since monogamy

"It would be useful to have a look at some of the old cases on the subject. In
Re Ram Kumari 1891 Calcutta 246 where a Hindu wife became convert to the Muslim
faith and then married a Mohammedan, it was held that her earlier marriage with a
Hindu husband was not dissolved by her conversion. She was charged and convicted
of bigamy under Section 494 of the IPC."
"In Gul Mohammed v. Emperor AIR 1947 Nagpur 121 a Hindu
wife was fraudulently taken away by the accused a Mohammedan who married her
according to Muslim law after converting her to Islam. It was held that the
conversion of the Hindu wife to Mohammedan faith did not ipso facto dissolve the
marriage and she could not during the life time of her former husband enter into a
valid contract of marriage. Accordingly the accused was convicted for adultery under
Section 497 of the IPC."
"She was charged with an offence under Section 494
of the Indian Penal Code. It was held that the mere fact of her conversion to Islam did
not dissolve the marriage which could only be dissolved by a decree of court. Emperor vs. Mt."

""The parties were originally Jews bound by the Jewish personal law..."
"I can see no reason why the Mahommedan
Law should be preferred to the Jewish Law in a matrimonial dispute between a
Mahommdan and a Jew particularly when the relationship, viz. : marriage, was
created under the Jewish Law.. As I stated in a previous case there is no matrimonial
law of general application in India. There is a Hindu Law for Hindus, a
Mahommedan Law for Mahommedans, a Christian Law for Christians, and a Jewish
Law for Jews."
"There is a Hindu Law for Hindus, a
Mahommedan Law for Mahommedans, a Christian Law for Christians, and a Jewish
Law for Jews. There is no general matrimonial law regarding mixed marriages other
than the statute law, and there is no suggestion that the statute law is applicable in
the present case.. It may be that a marriage solemnised according to Jewish rites may
be dissolved by the proper authority under Jewish Law when one of the parties
renounces the Jewish Faith."

Court in Robasa Khanum vs. Khodadad Bomanji Irani 1946 Bombay Law Reporter
864."
"The wife
became Muslim whereas the husband declined to do so. The wife claimed that her
marriage stood dissolved because of her conversion to Islam. The learned Judge
dismissed the suit."
"The Bench upheld the judgment of Blagden, J. and dismissed the appeal. Chagla, J. Chagla, J. elaborating the legal position held as under:-
""We have here a Muslim wife according to whose personal law conversion to Islam, if
the other spouse does not embrace the same religion, automatically dissolves the
marriage. We have a Zoroastrian husband according to whose personal law such
conversion does not bring about the same result."
"But there is no rule of English law which can be made applicable
to a suit for divorce by a Muslim wife against her Zoroastrian husband. The English
law only deals and can only deal with Christian marriages and with grounds for
dissolving a Christian marriage.Smt. Sarla Mudgal, President, Kalyani & ... vs Union Of India & Ors on 10 May, 1995
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/733037/ 6Therefore we must decided according to justice and right, or equity and good
conscience independently of any provisions of the English law."
"It is impossible to
accept the contention of Mr. Peerbhoy that justice and right requires that we should
apply Muslim law in dealing this case. It is difficult to see why the conversion of one
party to a marriage should necessarily afford a ground for its dissolution. The bond
that keeps a man and woman happy in marriage is not exclusively the bond of
religion."
"It is difficult to see why the conversion of one
party to a marriage should necessarily afford a ground for its dissolution. The bond
that keeps a man and woman happy in marriage is not exclusively the bond of
religion. There are many other ties which make it possible for a husband and wife to
live happily and contentedly together."
"There are many other ties which make it possible for a husband and wife to
live happily and contentedly together. It would indeed be a startling proposition to
lay down that although two persons may want to continue to live in a married state
and disagree as to the religion they should profess, their marriage must be
automatically dissolved. Mr. Peerbhoy has urged that it is rarely possible for two
persons of different communities to be happily united in wedlock."
"Mr. Peerbhoy has urged that it is rarely possible for two
persons of different communities to be happily united in wedlock. If conversion of
one of the spouses leads to unhappiness, then the ground for dissolution of marriage
would not be the conversion but the resultant unhappiness. Under Muslim law,
apostasy from Islam of either party to a marriage operates as a complete and
immediate dissolution of the marriage."

natural justice and as such would be void. The interpretation we have given to Section 494 IPC would advance the interest of justice."
"Result of the interpretation, we have given to Section 494
IPC, would be that the Hindu Law on the one hand and the Muslim Law on the other hand would
operate within their respective ambits without trespassing on the personal laws of each other. Since
it is not the object of Islam nor is the intention of the enlighten Muslim community that the Hindu
husbands should be encouraged to become Muslims merely for the purpose of evading their own
personal laws by marrying again, the courts can be persuaded to adopt a construction of the laws
resulting in denying the Hindu husband converted to Islam the right to marry again without having
his existing marriage dissolved in accordance with law. All the four ingredients of Section 494 IPC are satisfied in the case of a Hindu husband who marries
for the second time after conversion to Islam."

Al."
"A Christian lady was married according to the Christian rites. Years later she
embraced Islamic faith and got married by the Registrar of Muslim Marriages at Colombo according
to the statutory formalities prescribed for a Muslim marriage. The husband was charged and
convicted by the Supreme Court, Ceylon of the offence of bigamy under the Ceylon Penal Code."
"In
an appeal before the Privy Council, the respondent was absolved from the offence of bigamy. It was
held by Privy Council as under :-
""In their Lordship's view, in such countries there must be an inherent right in the
inhabitants domiciled there to change their religion and personal law and so to
contract a valid polygamous marriage if recognised by the laws of the country
notwithstanding an earlier marriage. It such inherent right is to be abrogated, it must
be done by statute."""
"It such inherent right is to be abrogated, it must
be done by statute."" Despite there being an inherent right to change religion the applicability of Penal laws would
depend upon the two personal laws governing the marriage. The decision of Privy Council was on
the facts of the case, specially in the background of the two personal laws operating in Ceylon."
"One wonders how long will it take for the Government of the day to implement the mandate of the
framers of the Constitution under Article 44 of the Constitution of India. The traditional Hindu law -
personal law of the Hindus - governing inheritance, succession and marriage was given go- bye as
back as 1955-56 by codifying the same. There is no justification whatsoever in delaying indefinitely
the introduction of a uniform personal law in the country."
"Marriage, succession and like matters of a
secular character cannot be brought within the guarantee enshrined under Articles 25, 26 and 27. The personal law of the Hindus, such as relating to marriage, succession and the like have all a
sacramental origin, in the same manner as in the case of the Muslims or the Christians. The Hindus
alongwith Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains have forsaken their sentiments in the cause of the national
unity and integration, some other communities would not, though the Constitution enjoins the
establishment of a ""common civil Code"" for the whole of India."
"It can be superseded by the State just as it can prohibit human sacrifice or the practice of
""Suttee"" in the interest of public order. Bigamous marriage has been made punishable amongst
Christians by Act (XV of 1872), Parsis by Act (III of 1936) and Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains by
Act (XXV of 1955). Political history of India shows that during the Muslim regime, justice was administered by the
Qazis who would obviously apply the Muslim Scriptural law to Muslims, but there was no similar
assurance so far litigations concerning Hindus was concerned."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/733037/ 12the administration of civil justice for the native population, without discrimination between Hindus
and Mahomedans. The 1772 Regulations followed by the Regulations of 1781 whereunder it was
prescribed that either community was to be governed by its ""personal"" law in matters relating to
inheritance, marriage, religious usage and institutions. So far as the criminal justice was concerned
the British gradually superseded the Muslim law in 1832 and criminal justice was governed by the
English common law."
"Those who preferred to
remain in India after the partition, fully knew that the Indian leaders did not believe in two-nation
or three-nation theory and that in the Indian Republic there was to be only one Nation - Indian
nation - and no community could claim to remain a separate entity on the basis of religion. It would
be necessary to emphasise that the respective personal laws were permitted by the British to govern
the matters relating to inheritance, marriages etc. only under the Regulations of 1781 framed by
Warren Hastings."
"Sahai, J. in his short and crisp supporting opinion has
suggested some of the measures which can be undertaken by the Government in this
respect. Answering the questions posed by us in the beginning of the judgment, we hold that
the second marriage of a Hindu- husband after conversion to Islam, without having
his first marriage dissolved under law, would be invalid. The second marriage would
be void in terms of the provisions of Section 494 IPC and the apostate-husband
would be guilty of the offence under Section 494 IPC."
