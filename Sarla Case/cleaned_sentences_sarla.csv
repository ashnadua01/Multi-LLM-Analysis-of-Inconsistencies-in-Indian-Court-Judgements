of the matter and acting against the spirit of the statute if the second A30 of the convert is held
to be legal."
"the real reason for the voidness of the second A30 is the subsisting of the first A30 which
is not dissolved even by the E20 of the husband. it would be giving a go-bye to the substance
of the matter and acting against the spirit of the statute if the second A30 of the convert is held
to be legal. we also agree with the law laid down by chagla, j. in robasa khanum vs. khodabad irani's case
(supra) wherein the learned judge has held that the conduct of a spouse who converts to islam has
to be judged on the basis of the rule of justice and right or equity and good conscience."
"in such cases the court shall act and the judge shall
decide according to justice, equity and good conscience. the second A30 of a hindu husband
after embracing islam being violative of justice, equity and good conscience would be void on that
ground also and attract the provisions of section 494, ipc. looked from another angle, the second A30 of an apostate-husband would be in violation of
the rules of natural justice."

ground also and attract the provisions of section 494, ipc. looked from another angle, the second A30 of an apostate-husband would be in violation of

religion, he has no right under the act to marry again without getting his A30 under the act
dissolved."
"looked from another angle, the second A30 of an apostate-husband would be in violation of
the rules of natural justice. assuming that a hindu husband has a right to embrace islam as his

natural justice and as such would be void."

religion, he has no right under the act to marry again without getting his A30 under the act
dissolved. the second A30 after E20 to islam would, thus, be in violation of the rules of
natural justice and as such would be void. the interpretation we have given to section 494 ipc would advance the interest of justice."
"result of the interpretation, we have given to section 494
ipc, would be that the hindu law on the one hand and the muslim law on the other hand would
operate within their respective ambits without trespassing on the personal laws of each other. since
it is not the object of islam nor is the intention of the enlighten muslim community that the hindu
husbands should be encouraged to become muslims merely for the purpose of evading their own
personal laws by A7 the courts can be persuaded to adopt a construction of the laws
resulting in denying the hindu husband converted to islam the right to marry again without having
his existing A30 dissolved in accordance with law. all the four ingredients of section 494 ipc are satisfied in the case of a hindu husband who marries
for the second time after E20 to islam."

al."
"a christian lady was A6 according to the christian rites. years later she
embraced islamic faith and got A6 by the registrar of muslim marriages at colombo according
to the statutory formalities prescribed for a muslim A30 the husband was charged and
convicted by the supreme court, ceylon of the offence of E11 under the ceylon penal code."
"in
an appeal before the privy council, the respondent was absolved from the offence of E11 it was
held by privy council as under :-
""in their lordship's view, in such countries there must be an inherent right in the
inhabitants domiciled there to change their religion and personal law and so to
contract a valid polygamous A30 if recognised by the laws of the country
notwithstanding an earlier A30. it such inherent right is to be abrogated, it must
be done by statute."""
"it such inherent right is to be abrogated, it must
be done by statute."" despite there being an inherent right to change religion the applicability of penal laws would
depend upon the two personal laws governing the A30 the decision of privy council was on
the facts of the case, specially in the background of the two personal laws operating in ceylon."
"one wonders how long will it take for the government of the day to implement the mandate of the
framers of the constitution under article 44 of the constitution of india. the traditional hindu law -
personal law of the hindus - governing inheritance, succession and A30 was given go- bye as
back as T26 by codifying the same. there is no justification whatsoever in delaying indefinitely
the introduction of a uniform personal law in the country."
"A30 succession and like matters of a
secular character cannot be brought within the guarantee enshrined under articles 25, 26 and 27. the personal law of the hindus, such as relating to A30 succession and the like have all a
sacramental origin, in the same manner as in the case of the muslims or the christians. the hindus
alongwith sikhs, buddhists and jains have forsaken their sentiments in the cause of the national
unity and integration, some other communities would not, though the constitution enjoins the
establishment of a ""common civil code"" for the whole of india."
"it can be superseded by the state just as it can prohibit human sacrifice or the practice of
""suttee"" in the interest of public order. bigamous A30 has been made punishable amongst
christians by act (xv of 1872), parsis by act (iii of 1936) and hindus, buddhists, sikhs and jains by
act (xxv of 1955). political history of india shows that during the muslim regime, justice was administered by the
qazis who would obviously apply the muslim scriptural law to muslims, but there was no similar
assurance so far litigations concerning hindus was concerned."

and mahomedans. the T28 regulations followed by the regulations of T29 whereunder it was
prescribed that either community was to be governed by its ""personal"" law in matters relating to
inheritance, A30 religious usage and institutions. so far as the criminal justice was concerned
the british gradually superseded the muslim law in T30 and criminal justice was governed by the
english common law."
"those who preferred to
remain in india after the partition, fully knew that the indian leaders did not believe in two-nation
or three-nation theory and that in the indian republic there was to be only one nation - indian
nation - and no community could claim to remain a separate entity on the basis of religion. it would
be necessary to emphasise that the respective personal laws were permitted by the british to govern
the matters relating to inheritance, marriages etc. only under the regulations of T29 framed by
warren hastings."
"sahai, j. in his short and crisp supporting opinion has
suggested some of the measures which can be undertaken by the government in this
respect. answering the questions posed by us in the beginning of the judgment, we hold that
the second A30 of a hindu- husband after E20 to islam, without having
his first A30 dissolved under law, would be invalid. the second A30 would
be void in terms of the provisions of section 494 ipc and the apostate-husband
would be guilty of the offence under section 494 ipc."
