authority like the central government abuse of power  cannot
be  lightly assumed and in any event, if there is  abuse  if
the power the arms of the court are long enough to reach  it
and to strike it down. the power conferred on the  passport
authority  to  impound a passport under  section  10(3)  (c)
cannot be regarded as discriminatory. [684-d-h, 685 a-c]
the  law on the point viz."
"19(1)(g). the right to go abroad is clearly not a guaranteed right under
any clause of article 19(1) and section 10(3) (c) which authorises imposition of restrictions on the
right to go abroad by impounding of passport cannot be held as void as offending article 19(1)(a) or
(g), as its direct and inevitable impact is on the right to go abroad and not on the right of free speech
and expression or the right to carry on trade, business, profession or calling. [702 c-e] but that does
not mean that an order made under s. 10 (3) (c) may not violate article 19(1)(a) or (g)."
"therefore, even though section 10(3)(c) is valid, the question would always
remain whether an order made under it invalid as contravening a fundamental right. the direct and
inevitable effect of an order impounding a passport may, in a given case, be to abridge or take away
freedom of speech and expression or the right to carry on a profession and where such is the case,
the order would be invalid, unless saved by article 19(2) or article 19(6). [702f-h] narendra kumar

"though the impugned order may be within the terms of s. 10(3) (c), it must nevertheless not
contravene any fundamental right and if it does, it would be void. now, even if an order impounding
a passport is made in the interests of public order decency or morality, the restriction imposed by it
may be so wide, excessive disproportionate to the mischief or evil sought to be averted that it may be
considered unreasonable and in that event, if the direct and inevitable consequence of the order is to
abridge or take away freedom of speech and expression, it would be violative of article 19(1)(a) and
would not be protected by article 19(2) and the same would, be the position where the order is in the
interests of the general public but it infringes directly and inevitably on the freedom to carry on a
profession in which case it would contravene article 19(1) (g) without being saved by the provision
enacted ion article 19(6). [705 d-e] 6 3 5 the impugned order, in the present case does riot violate
either art."
"19(1)(g). what the impugned order does is to impound the passport of the
petitioner and thereby prevent her from going abroad and at the date, when impugned order was
made, there is nothing to show that the petitioner was intending to go abroad for the purpose of
exercising her freedom or speech and expression or her right to carry on her profession as a
journalist. the direct and inevitable consequence of the impugned order was to impede the exercise
of her right to go abroad and not to interfere with her freedom of speech and expression or her rightmaneka gandhi vs union of india on 25 january, 1978

"observation it is true that the power under s. 10(3) (c) is rather a drastic power to interfere with
a basic human right, but this power has been conferred by the legislature in public interest and there
is no doubt that it will be sparingly used and that too, with great care and circumspection and as far
as possible. the passport of a person will not be impounded merely on the ground of his being
required in connection with a proceeding, unless the case is brought within s. 10(3)(e) or sec. 10(3)(b)."
"b 693 quoted with approval. an order impounding a
passport can be made by the passport authority only if it is actually in the interests of the general
public to do so and it is not enough that the interests of the general public may be likely to be served
in future by the making of the order. in the present case, it was not merely on the future likelihood
of the interests of the general public being advanced that the impugned order was made by the
central government."

awareness has dawned."

accord with fair norms, free from extraneous pressure and, by and large, complying with natural
justice. unilateral arbitrariness, police dossiers, faceless affiants, behind- the-back materials oblique
motives and the inscrutable face of an official sphinx do not fill the 'fairness,' bill."
"hearing is obligatory-meaningful hearing, flexible and realistic,
according to circumstances' but not ritualistic and wooden. in exceptional cases and emergency
situations, interim measures may be taken, to avoid the mischief of the passportee becoming an. escapee before the hearing begins."
"but soon after the provisional seizure, a reasonable hearing must
follow, to minimise procedural prejudice. and when a prompt final order is made against the
applicant or passport holder the reasons must be disclosed to him almost invariably save in those
dangerous cases, where irreparable injury will ensue to the state. a government which revels in
secrecy in the field of people's liberty not only acts against democratic decency but busies itself with
its own burial."
"three sets of cases might
arise. first, where the legislative provision or executive' order expressly forbids exercise in foreign
lands of the-fundamental right while granting passport. secondly, there may be cases where even if

"if a
statutory provision can be read consistently with the principles of natural justice the court should do
so but if a statutory provision that specifically or by necessary implication excludes the application
of any rules of natural justice this court cannot ignore the mandate of the legislature or the statutory
authority and read into the concerned provision the principles of natural justice. to a limited extent
it may be necessary to revoke or to impound a passport without notice if there is real apprehension
that the holder of the passport may leave the country if he becomes aware of any intention on the
part of the passport authority or the government to revoke or impound the passport but that itself
would not justify denial of an opportunity to the holder of the passport to, state his case before the
final order is passed. the legislature has not by express provision excluded the right to be heard."
"149 referred to. a passport may be impounded without notice but before any final order is passed, the rule of audi

"i have had
the advantage of going through the opinions of each of my three learned brethren. it seems to me that there can be little doubt that the right to travel and to go outside the country,
which orders regulating issue, suspension or impounding, and cancellation of passports directly
affect, must be included in rights to ""personal liberty"" on the strength of decisions of this court
giving a very wide ambit to the right to personal liberty (see : satwant singh sawhney v. d.
ramarathnam, assistant passport officer, government of india, new delhi & ors.,(1) kharak singh
v. state of u.p. & ors."
"as has been pointed out by my learned brother bhagwati, by detailed references to cases, such as
haradhan saha v. the state of west bengal & ors(1) and shambhu nath sarkar v. state of west
bengal (2) , the view that articles 19 and 21 constitute water tight compartments, so that all aspects
of personal liberty could be excluded from article 19 of the constitution, had to be abandoned as a
result of what was held, by a larger bench of this court in r. c. cooper v. union of india(3), to be the
sounder view. therefore, we could ,neither revive that overruled doctrine nor could we now hold
that impounding or cancellation of a passport does not impinge upon and affect fundamental rights
guaranteed, by the constitution. i may point out that the doctrine that articles 19 and 21 protect or
regulate flows in different channels, which certainly appears to have found favour in this court in a.
k. gopalan's case (supra), was laid down in a context which was very different from that in which
that approach was displaced by the sounder view that the constitution must be read as an integral
whole, with possible over-lappings of the subject matter of what is sought to be protected by its
various provisions par- ticularly by articles relating to fundamental rights."
"we cannot disable article 14 or 19 from so
functioning and hold those executive and legislative actions to which they could apply
as unquestionable even when there is no emergency to shield actions of doubtful
legality. these tests are, in my opinion, available to us now to determine the
constitutional validity of section 10 (3) (c) of the act as well as of the impugned order
of 7th july, 1977, passed against the petitioner E4 ""in the
interest of general public"" and stating that the government bad decided not to
furnish her with a copy of reasons and claiming immunity from such disclosure
under section 10(5) of the act. i have already mentioned some of the authorities relied upon by me in a. d. m.
jabalpur v. s. shukla (supra), while discussing the scope of article 21 of the
constitution, to hold that its ambit is very wide."
"if rights under article 19 are rights which inhere in indian citizens, individuals concerned carry
these inherent fundamental constitutional rights with them wherever they go, in so far as our law
applies to them, because they are, parts of the indian nation just as indian ships, flying the indian
flag, are deemed, in international law, to be floating parts of indian territory. this analogy, however,
could not be pushed too far because indian citizens on foreign territory, are only entitled, by virtue
of their indian nationality and passports, to the protection of the indian republic and the assistance
of its diplomatic missions abroad. they cannot claim to be governed abroad by their own
constitutional or personal laws which do not operate outside india."
"both
substantive and procedural laws and actions taken under them will have to pass tests imposed by
articles 14 and 19 whenever facts justifying the invocation of either of these articles may be
disclosed. for example, an international singer or dancer may well be able to complain of an
unjustifiable restriction on professional activity by a denial of a passport. in such a case, violations
of both articles 21 and 19(1) (g) may both be put forward making it necessary for the authorities
concerned to justify the restriction imposed by showing satisfaction of tests of validity contemplated
by each of these two articles."
"otherwise, they would cease to be reasonable. thus, i think
that a discretion left to the authority to impound a passport in public interest cannot invalidate the
law itself. we cannot, out of fear that such power will be misused,-refuse to permit parliament to
entrust even such power to executive authorities as may be absolutely necessary to carry out the
purposes of a validly exercisable power."
"i think it has to be necessarily left to executive discretion to
decide whether, on the facts and circumstances of a particular case, public interest will or will not be
served by a particular order to be passed under a valid law subject, as it always is, to judicial
supervision. in matters such as grant, suspension, impounding or cancellation of passports, the
possible dealings of an individual with nationals and authorities of other states have to be
considered. the contemplated or possible activities abroad of the individual may have to be taken
into."
"(3 ) of the act will show that each of the orders which
could be passed under section 10, sub.s. (3) (a) to (h) requires a ""satisfaction"" by the passport
authority on certain objective conditions which must exist in a case before it passes an order to
impound a passport or a travel document. impounding or revocation are placed side by side on the
same footing in the provision."
"hence, section 10, subs. s. (5) makes
it obligatory upon the passport authority to ""record in writing a brief statement of the reasons for
making such order and furnish to the holder of the passport or travel document on, demand a copy
of the same unless in any case, the passport authority is of the opinion that it will not be in the
interests of the sovereignty and integrity of india, the security of india, friendly relations of india
with any foreign country or in the interests of the general public to furnish such a copy"". it seems to me, from the provisions of section 5, 7 and 8 of the act, read with other provisions, that
there is a statutory right also acquired, on fulfilment of prescribed conditions by the holder of a
passport, that it should continue to be effective for the specified period so long as no ground has
come into existence for either its revocation or for impounding it which amounts to a suspension of
it for the time being."

concerned with the enforcement of fundamental constitutional rights and not with any statutory
rights apart from fundamental rights."
"there can be no doubt whatsoever that the orders under section 10(3) must be based upon some
material even if that material consists, in some cases, of reasonable suspicion arising from certain
credible assertions made by reliable individuals. it may be that, in an emergent situation, the
impounding of a passport may become necessary without even giving an opportunity to be heard
against such a step, which could be reversed after an opportunity given to the holder of the passport
to show why the step was unnecessary, but, ordinarily, no passport could be reasonably either
impounded or revoked without giving a prior opportunity to its holder to show cause against the
proposed action. the impounding as well revocation of a passport, seem to constitute action in the
nature of a punishment necessitated on one of the grounds specified in the act."

thereunder for showing cause against action proposed to be taken against an individual, which
affects the rights of that individual, the duty to give reasonable opportunity to be heard will be
implied from the nature of the function to be performed by the authority which has the power to
take punitive or damaging action."
"not eaten of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou
shouldest not eat and the same question was put to eve also."" i find no difficulty whatsoever in holding, on the strength of these well recognised principles, that an
order impounding a passport must be made quasi-judicially. this was not done in the case before
us."
"this was not done in the case before
us. in my estimation, the findings arrived at by my learned brethren after an examination of the facts of
the case before us, with which i concur, indicate that it cannot be said that a good enough reason has
been shown to exist for E6 of the petitioner by the order dated 7th july, 1977. furthermore, the petitioner has bad no opportunity of showing that the ground for impounding it
finally given in this court either does not exist or has no bearing on public interest or that public
interest cannot be better served in some other manner."
"therefore, speaking for myself, i would
quash the order and direct the opposite parties to give an opportunity to the petitioner to show-
cause against any proposed action on such grounds as may be available. i am not satisfied that there were present any such pressing grounds with regard to the petitioner
before us that the immediate action of E4 was called for. furthermore, the
rather cavalier fashion in which disclosure of any reason for E4 was denied to
her, despite the fact that the only reason said to exist the possibility of her being called to give
evidence before a commission of inquiry and stated in the counter-affidavit filed in this court, is not
such as to be reasonably deemed to necessitate, its concealment in (1) 1863 (14) c.b."

"the attitude adopted by the attorney general however, shows that passport authorities realize fully
that the petitioner's case has not been justly or reasonably dealt with. as the undertaking given by
the attorney general amounts to an offer to deal with it justly and fairly after informing the
petitioner of any ground that may exist for E4 it seems that no further action
by this court may be necessary. in view, however, of what is practically an admission that the order
actually passed on 7th july, 1977, is neither fair nor procedurally proper, i would, speaking for
myself, quash this order and direct the return of the impounded passport to the petitioner."

(1) to the extent to which section 10(3) (c) of the passport act, 1967 authorises the
passport authority to impound a passport ""in the interests of the general public"", it is
violative of article 14 of the constitution since it confers vague and undefined power
on the passport authority;

for a hearing to the holder of the passport before the passport is, impounded;
(3) section 10(3)(c) is violative of article 21 of the constitution since it does not
prescribe 'procedure' within the meaning of that article and since the procedure
which it prescribes is arbitrary and unreasonable; and (4) section 10 (3)(c) offends
against articles 19(1)(a) and 19 (1 ) (g) since it permits restrictions to be imposed on
the rights guaranteed by these articles even though such restrictions cannot be
imposed under articles 19(2) and 19(6). at first, the passport authority exercising its power under section 10(5) of the act refused to furnish
to the petitioner the reason for which it was considered necessary in the interests of general public
to impound her passport."

"(1) this court ruled by majority that the expression ""personal liberty"" which
occurs in article 21 of the constitution includes the right to travel abroad and that no person can be
deprived of that right except according to procedure established by law. the passport act which was
enacted by parliament in 1967 in order to comply with that decision prescribes the procedure
whereby an application for a passport may be granted fully or partially, with or without any
endorsement, and a passport once granted may later be revoked or impounded. but the mere
prescription of some kind of procedure cannot ever meet the mandate of article
21."
"the measure of directness, as
held by brother bhagwati, is the 'inevitable' consequence of the impugned statute. these then are
the guidelines with the help of which one has to ascertain whether section 10(3) (c) of the passport
act which authorizes the passport authority to impound a passport or the impugned order passed
thereunder violates the guarantee of free speech and expression conferred by article 19(1) (a).maneka gandhi vs union of india on 25 january, 1978

that the right to go abroad cannot be comprehended within the right of free speech and expression
since the latter right is exercisable by the indian citizens within the geographical limits of india only. secondly, he contends, the right to go abroad is altogether of a different genre from the right of free
speech and expression and is therefore not a part of it."

because in this branch, one says no more than the facts warrant and decides nothing that does not
call for a decision. the fact that the petitioner was not heard before or soon after the impounding of
her passport would have introduced a serious infirmity in the order but for the statement of the
attorney general that the. government was, willing to hear the petitioner and further to limit the
operation of the order to a period of T13 from the date of the fresh decision, if the decision
was adverse to the petitioner."

provides for impounding of passport without any procedure as required by that
article, or, in any event, even if it could be said that there is some procedure
prescribed under the passport act, 1967, it is wholly arbitrary and unreasonable and,
therefore, not in compliance with the requirement of that article. the other ground
urged on behalf of the petitioner was that section 10(3)(c) is violative of articles
19(1)(a) and 19(1)(g) inasmuch as it authorises imposition of restrictions on freedom
of speech and expression guaranteed under article 19 (1 ) (a) and freedom to practise

regret that the central government should have taken up this attitude in reply to the request of the
petitioner to be supplied a copy of the statement of reasons, because ultimately, when the petition
came to be filed, the central government did disclose the reasons in the affidavit in reply to the
petition which shows that it was not really contrary to public interest and if we look at the reasons
given in the affidavit in reply, it will be clear that no reasonable person could possibly have taken the
view that the interests of the general public would be prejudiced by the disclosure of the reasons."
"this is an instance showing how power conferred on a statutory authority to act in the, interests of
the general public can sometimes be improperly exercised. if the petitioner had not filed the
petition, she would perhaps never have been able to find out what were the reasons for which her
passport was impounded and she was deprived of her right to go abroad. the necessity of giving
reasons has obviously been introduced in sub-section (5) so that it may act as a healthy check

reasons has obviously been introduced in sub-section (5) so that it may act as a healthy check

between the reasons and the ground on which the passport has been impounded, it would be open
to the holder of the passport to challenge the order impounding it in a court of law and if the court is
satisfied that the reasons are extraneous or irrelvant, the court would strike down the order. this
liability to be exposed to judicial scrutiny would by itself act as a safeguard against improper or mala
fide exercise of power."
"this
liability to be exposed to judicial scrutiny would by itself act as a safeguard against improper or mala

claim of the passport authority that it would not be in the interests of the general public to disclose
the reasons. the passport authority would have to satisfy the court by placing proper material that
the giving of reasons would be clearly and indubitably against the interests of the general public and

liberty in article 21 the first contention urged on behalf of the petitioner in support of the petition
was that the right to go abroad is part of 'personal liberty within the meaning of that expression as
used in article 21 and no one can."
"be deprived of this right except according to the procedure
prescribed by law. there is no procedure prescribed by the passport act, 1967 for impounding or
revoking a passport and thereby preventing the holder of the passport from going abroad and in any
event, even if some procedure can be traced in the relevant provisions of the act, it is unreasonable
and arbitrary, inasmuch as it does not provide for giving an opportunity to the holder of the
passport to be heard against the making of the order and hence the action of the central government
in E6 of the petitioner is in violation of article 21. this contention of the
petitioner raises a question as to the true interpretation of article 21, what is the nature and extent
of the protection afforded by this article ?"
"778.
held by this court in satwant singh's case that 'personal liberty' within the meaning of article 21
includes within its ambit the right to go abroad and consequently no person can be deprived of this
right except according to procedure prescribed by law. prior to the enactment of the passports act,
1967, there was no law regulating the right of a person to go abroad and that was the reason why the
order of the passport officer refusing to issue passport to the petitioner in satwant singh's case was
struck down as invalid. it win be seen at once from the language of article 21 that the protection it
secures is a limited one."
"it was for this reason, in order to comply with the requirement of article 21,
that parliament enacted the passports act, 1967 for regulating the tight to go abroad. it is clear from
the provisions of the passports, act, 1967 that is lays down the circumstances under which a
passport may be issued or refused or cancelled or impounded and also prescribes a procedure for
doing so, but the question is whether that is sufficient compliance with article 21. is the prescription
of some sort of procedure enough or must the procedure comply with any particular requirements ?"
"how far natural justice is
air essential element of procedure established by law. the question immediately arises : does the procedure prescribed by the passports act, 1967 for
impounding a passport meet the, test of this requirement ? is it 'right or fair or just' ?"
"is it 'right or fair or just' ? the argument
of the petitioner was that it is not, because it provides for impounding of a passport without
affording reasonable opportunity to the holder of the passport to be heard in defence. to impound
the passport of a person, said the petitioner, is a serious matter, since it prevents him from
exercising his constitutional right to go abroad and such a drastic consequence cannot in fairness be
visited without observing the principle of audi alteram partem."

the passport of a person, said the petitioner, is a serious matter, since it prevents him from
exercising his constitutional right to go abroad and such a drastic consequence cannot in fairness be
visited without observing the principle of audi alteram partem. any procedure which permits
impairment of the constitutional right to go abroad without giving reasonable opportunity to show
cause cannot but be condemned as unfair and unjust and hence, there is in the present case clear
infringement of the requirement of article 21."
"any procedure which permits
impairment of the constitutional right to go abroad without giving reasonable opportunity to show
cause cannot but be condemned as unfair and unjust and hence, there is in the present case clear
infringement of the requirement of article 21. now, it is true that there is no express provision in the
passports act, 1967 which requires that the audi alteram partem rule should be followed before
impounding a passport, but that is not conclusive of the question. if the statute makes itself clear on
this point, then no more question arises."
"the question is only in regard to the right of hearing which involves the audi alteram partem
rule. can it be imported in the procedure for impounding a passport ? we may commence the discussion of this question with a few general observations to emphasise the
increasing importance of natural justice in the field of administrative law."
"the law must, therefore, now be taken to be well settled that even in
an administrative proceeding, which involves civil consequences, the doctrine of natural justice
must be held to be applicable. now, here, the power conferred on the passport authority is to impound a passport and the
consequence of impounding a passport would be to impair the constitutional right of the holder of
the passport to go abroad during the time that the passport is impounded. moreover, a passport can be impounded by the passport authority only on certain specified grounds
set out in sub-section (3) of section 10 and the passport authority would have to apply its mind to
the facts and circumstances of a given case and decide whether any of the specified grounds exists
which would justify impounding of the passport."

nemo debt esse judex propria cause : no one shall be a judge in his own cause, and audi alteram
partem : no decision shall be given against a party without affording him a reasonable hearing."
"but fortunately no such argument was advanced by
the learned attorney general. what he urged was a very limited contention, namely that having
regard to the nature of the action involved in the impounding of a passport, the audi alteram partem
rule must be held to, be excluded, because if notice were to be given to the hol- der of the passport
and reasonable opportunity afforded to him to show cause why his passport should not be
impounded, he might immediately, on the strength of the passport, make good his exit from the
country and the object of E6 would be frustrated. the argument was that if
the audi alteram partem rule were applied, its effect would be to stultify the power of impounding
the passport and it would defeat and paralyse the administration of the law and hence the audi
alteram partem rule cannot in fairness be applied while exercising the power to impound a passport."

judicial review of administrative action, 2nd ed., where the learned author says at page 174 that ""in
administrative, law a prima facie right to prior notice and opportunity to be heard may be held to be
excluded by implication-where an obligation to give notice and opportunity to be heard would
obstruct the taking of prompt action, especially action of a preventive or remedial nature""."
"this circumstantial flexibility of the audi alteram partem rule was empbasised by lord reid in
wiseman v. sorneman (supra) when he said that he would be ""sorry to see this fundamental general
principle degenerate into a series of hard and fast rules"" and lord hailsham, l.c., also observed in
pearl-berg v. party(2) that the courts ""have taken in increasingly sophisticated view of what is
required in individual cases"". it would not, therefore, be right to conclude that the audi alteram
partem rule is excluded merely because the power to impound a passport might be frustrated, if
prior notice and hearing were to be given to the person concerned before impounding his passport.maneka gandhi vs union of india on 25 january, 1978

no longer be assailed on the ground that it does not comply with the audi alteram

1967."
"we will first dispose of the
challenge based on article 14 as it lies in a very narrow compass. the argument tinder
this head of challenge, was that section 10(3) (c) confers unguided and unfettered
power on the passport authority to impound a passport and hence it is violative of
the equality clause contained in article 14. it was conceded that under section 10 (3)
(c) the power to impound a passport can be exercised only upon one or more of the,
stated grounds, but the complaint was that the ground of ""interests of the general
public""."

decision of the central government that it is in public interest to impound a passport

particularly in the central government, is thus unfettered and unrestricted and this
is plainly in violation of article 14."
"but here it is difficult to say that the discretion conferred on the passport authority is
arbitrary or unfettered. there are four grounds set out in section 10(3) (c) which
would justify the making of an order impounding a passport. we are concerned only
with the last ground denoted by the words ""in the interests of the general public"", for
that is the ground which is attacked as vague and indefinite."

than the constitutional provision in article 19(5) and adhere loyally to the verbal
formula adopted in the constitution ? we are clearly of the view that sufficient
guidelines are provided by the, words ""in the interests of the general public"" and the
power conferred on the passport authority to impound a passport cannot be said to
be unguided or unfettered. moreover, it must be remembered that the exercise of this
power is not made dependent on the subjective opinion of the passport authority as
regards the necessity of exercising it on one or more of the grounds stated in the
section, but the passport authority is required to record in writing a brief statement
of reasons for E6 and, save in cer-
tain exceptional circumstances, to supply a copy of such statement to the person
affected, so that the person concerned can challenge the decision of the passport
authority in appeal and the appellate authority can examine whether the reasons
given by the passport authority are correct, and if so, whether they justify the making
of the order E6."

authority like the central government, abuse of power cannot be lightly assumed."
"and in any event, if there is abuse of power, the arms of the court are long enough to
reach it and to strike it down. the power conferred on the passport authority to
impound a passport under section 10(3)
(c) cannot, therefore, be regarded as discriminatory and it does not fall foul of article
14. but every exercise of such power has to be tested in order to determine whether it
is arbitrary or within the guidelines provided in section 10(3)
(c)."
"the right to go abroad is, as held in satwant
singh sawhney's case, included in personal liberty' within the meaning of article 21 and is thus a
fundamental right protected by that article. when the state issues a passport and grants
endorsement for one country, but refuses for another, the person concerned can certainly go out of
india but he is prevented from going to the country for which the endorsement is refused and his
right to go to that country is taken away. this cannot be done by the state under article 21 unless
there is a law authorising the state to do so and the action is taken in accordance with the procedure
prescribed by such law."
"the right of free speech and expression can have meaningful content and its exercise can
be effective only if the right to travel abroad is ensured and without it, freedom of speech and
expression would be limited by geographical constraints. the impounding of the passport of a
person with a view to preventing him from going abroad to communicate his ideas or share his
thoughts and views with others or to express himself through song or dance or other forms and
media of expression is direct interference with freedom of speech and expression. it is clear, so ran
the argument, that in a complex and developing society, where fast modes of transport and
communication have narrowed down distances and brought people living in different parts of the
world together, the right to associate with like minded persons in other parts of the globe, for themaneka gandhi vs union of india on 25 january, 1978

freedom of speech and expression which cannot be effectively implemented without the right to go
abroad."
"the first was the decision in kent v. dulles (supra). the supreme court laid down
in this case that the right to travel is guaranteed by the fifth amendment and held that the denial of

"the question which arose for determination in this case related to the constitutional
validity 'of section 6 of the subversive activities control act, 1950. this section prohibited the use of
passports by communists following a final registration order by the subversive activities control
board under section 7 and following the mandate of this section, the state department revoked the
existing passports of the appellants. after exhausting all administrative remedies, the appellants
sued for declarative and injunctive relief before the district court which upheld the validity of the
section."
"the last decision cited by the petitioner was zemel . v. rusk 2) this case raised the question
whether the secretary of state was statutorily authorised to refuse to validate the passports of
united states citizens for travel to cuba and if so, whether the exercise of such authority was
constitutionally permissible. the court, by a majority of six against three, held that the ban on travel
to cuba was authorised by the broad language of the passport act, 1926 and that such a restriction
was constitutional."
"2d 179.
the majority observed that having regard to administrative practice both before and after 1926, area
restrictions were statutorily authorised and that necessitated consideration of zemel's constitutional
objections. the majority took the view that freedom of movement was a right protected by the
'liberty' clause of the fifth amendment and that the secretary of state was justified in attempting to
avoid serious international incidents by restricting travel to cuba and summarily rejected zemel's
contention that the passport denial infringed his first amendment rights by preventing him frommaneka gandhi vs union of india on 25 january, 1978

black dissented in separate opinions."
"now,
obviously, the majority decision is of- no help to the petitioner. the majority rightly
pointed out that in kent v. dulles and aptheker v. secretary of state there was direct
interference with freedom of association by refusal to validate the passport, since the
appellant was required to give up membership of the organisation if he wanted
validation of the passport. such was not the case in zemel v. rusk and that is why,
said the majority it was not a first amendment right which was involved."
"such was not the case in zemel v. rusk and that is why,
said the majority it was not a first amendment right which was involved. it appeared
clearly to be the view of the, majority that if the denial of passport directly affects a
first amendment right such as freedom of expression or association as in kent v.
dulles and aptheker v. secretary of state, it would be constitutionally invalid. the
majority did not accept the contention that the right to travel for gathering
information is in itself a first amendment right."
"so also, for the same reasons, the right to go abroad cannot be treated as
part of the, right to carry on trade, business, profession or calling guaranteed under article 19(1) (g). the right to go abroad is clearly not a guaranteed right under any clause of article 19(1 ) and section
10(3) (c) which authorises imposition of restrictions on the right to go abroad by impounding of
passport cannot be held to be void as offending article 19(1) (a) or (g), as its direct and inevitable
impact is on the right. to go abroad and not on the right of free speech and expression or the."
"but that does not mean that an order made under section 10 (3) (c) may not violate article 19(1) (a)
or (g). while discussing the constitutional validity of the impugned order E6
of the petitioner, we shall have occasion to point out that even where a statutory provision
empowering an authority to take action is constitutionally valid, action taken under it may offend a
fundamental right and in that event, though the statutory provision is valid, the action may be void. therefore, even though section 10(3) (c) is valid, the question would always remain whether an
order made under it is invalid as contravening a fundamental right."
"the direct and inevitable. effect
of an order impounding a passport may, in a given case, be to abridge or take away freedom of
speech and expression or the right to carry on a profession and where such is the case, the order
would be invalid, unless saved by article 19(2) or article 19(6). take for example, a pilot with
international flying licence."
"take for example, a pilot with
international flying licence. international flying is his profession and if his passport is impounded, it
would directly interfere with his right to carry on his profession and unless the order can be justified
on the ground of public interest under article 19(6) it would be void as offending article 19 (1) (g). another example may be taken of an evangelist who has made it a mission of his life to preach his
faith to people all over the world and for that purpose, set up institutions in different countries."
"another example may be taken of an evangelist who has made it a mission of his life to preach his
faith to people all over the world and for that purpose, set up institutions in different countries. if an
order is made impounding his passport, it would directly affect his freedom of speech and
expression and the challenge to the validity of the order under, article 19 (1) (a) would be
unanswerable unless it is saved by article 19(2). we have taken these two examples only by way of
illustration."
"a musician may want to go abroad to
sing, a dancer to dance, a visiting professor to teach and a scholar to participate in a conference or
seminar. if in such a case his passport is denied or impounded, it would directly interfere with hismaneka gandhi vs union of india on 25 january, 1978

though the right to go abroad is not a fundamental right, the denial of the right to go abroad may, in
truth and in effect, restrict freedom of speech and expression or freedom to carry on a profession so
as to contravene article 19 (1) (a) or 19 (1)

10(3)(c) if the passport authority deems it necessary so to do in the interests of the sovereignty and

each of them, though separately mentioned, is a species within the broad genus of ""interests of the
general public""."
"if the order cannot be shown to have been made in the interests of public order,
decency or morality, it would not only contravene article 19 (1) (a), but would also be outside the

indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1766147/ 85we may now consider, in the light of this discussion, whether the impugned order
made by the central government E6 of the petitioner under
section 10(3) (c) suffers from any constitutional or legal infirmity. the first ground of
attack against the validity of the impugned order was that it was made in
contravention of the rule of natural justice embodied in the maxim audi alteram
partem and was, therefore, null and void."
"it is not necessary to say anything
more about it. another ground of challenge urged on behalf of the, petitioner was
that the impugned order has the effect of placing an unreasonable restriction on the
right of free speech and expression guaranteed to the petitioner under article 19 (1)
(a) as also on the right to carry on the profession of a journalist conferred under
article; 19(1) (g), in as much as if seeks to impound the passport of the petitioner
idefinitely, without any limit of time, on the mere likelihood of her being required in
connection with the commission of inquiry headed by mr. justice j. c. shah. it was
not competent to the central government, it was argued, to express an opinion as to
whether the petitioner is likely to be required in connection with the proceeding
before the commission of inquiry."
"that would be a matter within the judgment of the
commission of inquiry and it would be entirely for the commission of inquiry to
decide whether or, not her presence is necessary in the proceeding before it. the
impugned order E6 of the petitioner on the basis of a mere
opinion by the central government that the petitioner is likely to be required in
connection with the proceeding before the commission of inquiry was, in the
circumstances, clearly unreasonable and hence violative of article 19(1) (a) and (g). this ground of challenge was vehemently pressed on behalf of the petitioner and
supplemented on behalf of adil sahariar who intervened at the hearing of the writ
petition, but we do not think there is any substance in it."
"it would thus be clear that though the impugned order may be within the
terms of section 10(3) (c), it must nevertheless not contravene any fundamental rights and if it does,
it would be void. now, even if an order impounding a passport is made in the interests of public
order, decency or morality, the restriction imposed by it may be so wide, excessive or
disproportionate to the mischief or evil sought to be averted that it may be considered unreasonablemaneka gandhi vs union of india on 25 january, 1978
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1766147/ 87and in that event, if the direct and inevitable consequence,, of the order is to abridge or take away
freedom of speech and expression, it would be violative of article 19(1) (a) and would not be
protected by article 19(2) and the same would be the position where the, order is in the interests of
the' general public but it impinges directly and inevitably on the freedom to carry on a profession in
which case it would contravene article 19 (1) (g) without being saved by the provision enacted in
article 19(6). but we do not think that the impugned order in the present case violates either article 19(1) (a) or
article 19(1) (g)."
"but we do not think that the impugned order in the present case violates either article 19(1) (a) or
article 19(1) (g). what the impugned order does is to impound the passport of the petitioner and
thereby prevent her from going abroad and at the date when the impugned order was made there is
nothing to show that the petitioner was intending to go abroad for the purpose of exercising her
freedom of speech and expression or her right to carry on her profession as a journalist. the direct
and inevitable consequence of the impugned order was to impede the exercise of her right to go
abroad and not to interfere with her freedom of speech and expression or her right to carry on her
profession."
"the direct
and inevitable consequence of the impugned order was to impede the exercise of her right to go
abroad and not to interfere with her freedom of speech and expression or her right to carry on her
profession. but we, must hasten to point out that if at any time in the future the petitioner wants to
go abroad for the purpose of exercising her freedom of speech and expression or for carrying on her
profession as a journalist and she applies to the central government to release the passport, the
question would definitely arise whether the refusal to release or in other words, continuance of the
impounding of the passport is in the interests of public order, decency or morality in the first case,
and in the interests of the general public in the second, and the restriction thus imposed is
reasonable so, as to come within the protection of article 19(2) or article 19(6). that is, however, not
the question before us at present."
"that is, however, not
the question before us at present. we may observe that if the impugned order E6 of the petitioner were
violative, of her right to freedom of speech and expression or her right to carry on her profession as
a journalist, it would not be saved by article 19(2) or article 19(6), because the impounding of the
passport for an indefinite length of time would clearly constitute an unreasonable restriction. the
union contended that though the period for which the impugned order was to operate was not
specified in so many terms, it was clear that it was intended to be co-terminous with the duration of
the commission of inquiry, since the reason for impounding was that the presence of the petitioner
was likely to be required in connection with the proceedings before the com- mission of inquiry and
the term of the commission of inquiry being limited upto 31st december, 1977, the impoundig of
the passport could not continue beyond that date and hence it would not be said that the impugned
order was to operate for an indefinite period of time."

not only constitutional and legally but also fairly and justly towards the citizen. we hope and trust
that in future also whenever the passport of any person is impounded under section 10(3) (c), the
impounding would be for a specified period of time which is not unreasonably long, even though no
contravention of any fundamental right may be involved. the last argument that the impugned order could not, consistently with article 19(1) (a) and (g), be
based on a mere opinion of the central government that the presence of the petitioner is likely to be
required in connection with the proceeding before the commission of lnquiry is also without force."
"the impugned order is plainly, on the face of it,
purported to be made in public interest, i.e., in the interests of the general public, and therefore, its
validity must be judged on that footing. now it is obvious that on a plain natural construction of
section 10(3)(c), it is left to the passport authority to determine whether it is necessary to impound
a passport in the interests of the general public. but an order made by the passport authority
impounding a passport is subject to judicial review on the ground that the order is mala fide, or that
the reasons for making the order are extraneous or they have no relevance to the interests of the
general public or they cannot possibly support the making of the order in the interests of the general

not in the interests of the general public to do so, it realised the utter untenability of this position
when it came to file the affidavit in reply and disclosed the reasons which were recorded at the time
when the impugned order 'was passed. these reasons were that, according to the central
government, the petitioner was involved in matters coming within the purview of the commissions
of inquiry constituted by the government of india to inquire into excesses committed during the
emergency and in respect of matters concerning maruti and its associate companies and the central
government was of the view that the petitioner should be available in india to give evidence before
these commissions of inquiry and she should have an opportunity to present her views before them
and according to, a report received by the central government on that day, there was likelihood of
her leaving india."
"the argument of the, petitioner was that these reasons did not justify the making
of the, impugned order in the interests of the general public, since these reasons had no reasonable
nexus with the interests of the general public within the meaning of that expression as used in
section 10(3) (c). the petitioner contended that the expression ""interests of the general public"" must
be construed in the context of the perspective of the statute and since the power to issue a passport
is a power related to foreign affairs, the ""interests of the general public,"" must be understood as
referable only to a matter having some nexus with foreign affairs and it would not be given a wider
meaning. so read, the expression ""interests of the general public"" could not cover a situation where
the presence of a person required to give evidence before a commission of inquiry."
"the petitioner then contended that the requirement that she should be available for giving evidence
before the commissions of inquiry did not warrant the making of the impugned order ""in the
interests of the general public"". section 10(3),according to the petitioner, contained clauses
(e) and (h) dealing specifically with cases where a person is required in connection with a legal
proceeding and the enactment of these two specific provisions clearly indicated the legislative intent
that the general power in section 10(3) (c) under the ground ""interests of the general public""
was not meant to be exercised for impounding a passport in cases where a person is
required in connection with a legal proceeding. the central government was,
therefore, not entitled to resort to this general power under section 10(3)

little difficult for us to appreciate it. the petitioner urged that in order that a passport may be
impounded under section 10(3) (c), public interest must actually exist ill presenti and mere
likelihood of public interest arising in future, would be no ground for impoundig a passport. we
entirely agree with the petitioner that an order impounding a passport can be made by the passport

the interests of the general public may be likely to be served in future by the making of the order."

"in fact, the ministry of home affairs had forwarded to the ministry of external affairs as far
back as 9th may, 1977 a list of persons whose presence, in view of their involvement or connection
or position or past antecedents, was likely to be required in connection with inquiries to be carried
out by the commissions of inquiry and the name of the petitioner was included in this list. the
home ministry had also intimated to the ministry of external affairs that since the inquiries were
being held by the commissions of inquiry in public interest, consideration of public interest would
justify recourse to section 10(3) (c) for impounding the passports of the persons mentioned in this
list. this note of the ministry of home affairs was considered by the minister for external affairs
and despite the suggestion made in this note, the passports of only eleven persons, out of those
mentioned in the list, were ordered to be impounded and no action was taken in regard to the
passport of the petitioner."

confidential information that the petitioner was likely to attempt to leave the country that, after
applying his mind to the relevant material and taking into account confidential information, he

"we do not, therefore, see any reason to interfere with the impugned order made by the central
government. we, however, wish to utter a word of caution to the passport authority while
exercising the power of refusing or impounding or cancelling a passport. the passport authority
would do well to remember that it is a basic human right recognised in article 13 of the universal

"in our jural order if a statute is void, must the constitution
and its sentinels sit by silently, or should the lines of legality be declared with clarity so that
adherence to valid norms becomes easy and precise ?. we are directly concerned, as fully brought
out in shri justice bhagwati's judgment, with the indefinite immobilisation of the petitioner's
passport, the reason for the action being strangely veiled from the victim and the right to voice an
answer being suspiciously withheld from her, the surprising secrecy being labelled, 'public interest'. paper curtains wear ill 'on good governments."
"as we saw the reasons
which the learned attorney general so unhesitatingly disclosed, the question arises :
'wherefore are these things hid?'. the catch-all expression 'public interest' is
'sometimes the easy temptation to cover up from the public which they have a right to
know, which appeals in the short run but avenges in the long run since the only

"british raj has frowned on foreign travels by indian patriotic suspects and instances from the

passport and visa system as potent paper curtain to inhibit illustrious writers, outstanding

"absent forensic sentinels, it is not unusual for people to be suppressed by power

personal locomotion to serve its interests. the twilight of liberty must affect the thought ways of

"to argue for arbitrary inhibition of travel
rights under executive directive or legislative tag is to invite and accelerate future shock. this
broader setting is necessary if we, are to view the larger import of the right to passport in its
fundamental bearings. it is not law alone but life's leaven."
"passport
legality, affecting as it does, freedoms that are 'delicate and vulnerable, as well as supremely
precious in our society', cannot but excite judicial vigilance to obviate fragile dependency for
exercise of fundamental rights upon executive clemency. so important is this subject that themaneka gandhi vs union of india on 25 january, 1978

passport policy. conscious, though i am, that such prolix elaboration of environmental aspects is
otiose, the emergency provsions of our constitution, the extremes of rigour the nation has
experienced (or may) and the proneness of power to stoop to conquer make necessitous the
hammering home of vital values expressed in terse constitutional vocabulary."
"the american courts have, in a sense, blazed the constitutional trail on that facet of liberty which
relates to untrammelled travel. kent, apthekar and zemel are the landmark cases and american
jurisprudence today holds as a fundamental part of liberty (v amendment) that a citizen has
freedom to move across the frontiers without passport restrictions subject, of course, to well-defined
necessitous exceptions. basically, blackstone is still current coin ""personal liberty consists in the
power of locomotion, of changing direction or moving one's person to whatever place one's own
inclination may desire."""
"a
valuable constitutional right can be canalised only by civilised processes. you cannot claim that it is
a legal procedure if the passport is granted or refused by taking loss, ordeal of fire or by other
strange or mystical methods. nor is it tenable if life is taken by a crude or summary process of
enquiry."
"my clear conclusion on art. 21 is that liberty of locomotion into alien
territory cannot be unjustly forbidden by the establishment and passport legislation
must take processual provisions which accord with fair norms, free from extraneous
pressure and, by and large, complying with natural justice. unilateral arbitrariness,
police dossiers, faceless affiants, behind-the-back materials, oblique motives and the
inscrutable face of an official sphinx do not fill the 'fairness' bill-subject, of course, to
just exceptions and critical contexts."

"hearing is obligatory- meaningful hearing, flexible
and realistic, according to circumstances, but hot ritualistic and wooden. in exceptional cases and
emergency situations, interim measures may be taken, to avoid the mischief of the passportee
becoming an escapee before the hearing begins. 'bolt the stables after the horse has been stolen' is
not a command of 'natural justice."
"but soon after the provisional seizure, a reasonable hearing must
follow, to minimise procedural prejudice. and when a prompt final order is made against the
applicant or passport holder the reasons must be disclosed to him almost invariably save in those
dangerous cases where irreparable injury will ensue to the state. a government which reveals in
secrecy in the field of people's liberty not only acts against democratic decency but busies itself with
its own burial."

extra-territorial travel to assure which is the primary office of an indian passport, a facet of the
freedom of speech and expression, of profession or vocation under article 19? (1) [1973] 3 s.c.r."
"more importantly, restraints are
permissible only to the extent they have nexus with the approved object. for instance, in a wide
sense, 'the interests of the general public' are served by a family planning programme but it may be
constitutional impertinence to insist that passports may be refused if sterilisation certificates were
not produced. likewise, it is in public interest to widen streets in cities but monstrous to impound a
passport because its holder has declined to demolish his house which projects into the street line."

"19. as a component thereof, as also by way of separate submission, it was urged that the direct effect
of the passport law (and refusal thereunder) was not a blow on freedom of speech, of association or
of profession and, therefore, it could not be struck down even if it overflowed art. 19(2), (4) and (6)."
"is freedom of speech
integrally interwoven with locomotion ? is freedom of profession done to death if a professional, by
passport refusal without reference to art. 19 (f ), is inhibited from taking up a job offered abroad ?"
"even thoughts, ideologies and habits travel beyond. tourists crowd out
airline services; job- seekers rush to passport offices; lecture tours, cultural exchanges,
trans-national evangelical meets, scientific and scholarly studies and workshops and seminars
escalate, and international associations abound-all for the good of world peace and human progress,
save where are involved high risks to sovereignty, national security and other substantial
considerations which constitutions and courts have readily recognised. our free system is not so
brittle or timorous as to be scared into tabooing citizens trips abroad, except conducted tours or
approved visits sanctioned by the central executive and indifferent to art."
"such being the value and
function of free speech, what are the dynamics of limitation which will fit these values
and functions without retarding social goals or injuring social interest ? it is in this
background that we have to view the problem of passports and the law woven around
it. there are two ways of looking at the question .... as a facet of liberty and as an
ancient of expression."""
"there are two ways of looking at the question .... as a facet of liberty and as an
ancient of expression."" thomas emerson comments on passports from these dual
angles :
travel abroad should probably be classified as 'action' rather than ""expression"". in
commonsense terms travel is more physical movement than communication of ideas."
"three sets of cases may be thought of. firstly, where the legislative provision or executive order
expressly forbids exercise in foreign lands of the fundamental right while grunting passport. secondly, there may be cases where even if the order is- innocent on its face, the refusal of
permission to go to a foreign country may, with certainty and immediacy, spell denial of free speech
and professional practice or business."
"the first class may be illustrated. if the passport authority specifically conditions the permission
with a direction not to address meetings abroad or not to be a journalist or professor in a foreign
country, the order violate art. 19(1) (a) or (f) and stands voided unless art."
"free speech may similarly be bit by
restriction on a campaigner for liberation of colonial peoples or against genocide before the united
nations organisation. refusal in such cases is hit on the head by negation of a national passport and
can be rescued only by compliance with the relevant saving provisions , in art. 19(2), (4) or (6)."
"i supposing a lawyer or doctor, expert or exporter, missionary or guru, has to visit a
foreign country profession-ally or on a speaking assignment. he is effectively disabled from
discharging his pursuit if passport is refused. there the direct effect, the necessary consequence, the
immediate impact of the embargo on grant of passport (or its subsequent impounding or
revocation) is the infringement of the right to expression or profession'."

unconstitutional unless the relevant part of art."
"all this poured out by cable and radio to all
parts of the world, to the distress of all our friends and to the delight of all our foes i
am in favour of this freedom, which no other country would use, or dare to use, in
times of mortal peril such as those through which we are passing."" i wholly agree that spies, traitors, smugglers, saboteurs of the health, wealth and survival or

to fit the reasonableness test and humanised by natural justice."

never forget that freedom is recreated year by year, that freedom is as freedom does, that we have
gained a republic 'if we can keep it' and that the water-
shed between a police state and a people's raj is located partly through its passport policy. today, a

indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1766147/ 114that the petitioner was attempting or was likely to attempt to leave the country and thereby hamper
the functioning of the commissions of inquiry."
"so far as this allegation was concerned as it was not taken into account
in passing the order it was given up during the hearing of the writ petition. the only ground on
which the petitioner's passport was impounding was that she was likely to be examined by the
commission of inquiry and her presence was necessary in india. several questions of law were raised."
"several questions of law were raised. it was submitted that the petitioner was a journalist by
profession and that she intended to proceed to west germany in connection with her professional
duties, as a journalist and that by denying her the passport not only was her right to travel abroad
denied but her fundamental rights guaranteed under article 19(1) were infringed. the contention
was that before an order passed under article 21 of the constitution could be valid, it should not
only satisfy the requirements of that article, namely that the order should be according to the
procedure established by law, but also should not in any way infringe on her fundamental rights
guaranteed under article 19(1)."
"the right of a citizen to leave any country and to return to his country is recognised in
the united states. while there is no restriction on the citizen to return to his own
country the government of the united states does place certain restrictions for
leaving the country, such as obtaining of the passports etc. even the right to travel
outside the united states is not unrestricted."
"even the right to travel
outside the united states is not unrestricted. a passport is a request by the
government which grants it to a foreign government that the bearer of the passport
may pass safely and freely. the passport is considered as a licence for leaving a
country and an exit permit rather than a letter of introduction."
"a passport is a request by the

to countries in-which the united states have no diplomatic representation as the
position of the government is that it will not facilitate overseas travel where it is
unable to afford any protection to the traveller."

country.maneka gandhi vs union of india on 25 january, 1978
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1766147/ 123in the view that a citizen is not entitled to the fundamental rights guaranteed under
art. 19 outside the territorial limits of india,- the contention of the learned counsel
for the petition that by denying him the passport to travel outside india, his
fundamental rights like freedom of speech and expression, to assemble peaceably, to
practise profession or to carry on occupation, trade or business are infringed, cannot
be accepted. the passport of the petitioner was impounded on the ground that her

presence in connection with the inquiry commission may be necessary and in the
interest of public it was necessary to do so. the impugned order does not place any
restrictions on the petitioner while she is away from india."
"hence the question
whether the state could impose such restraint does not arise in this case. as the
contention was that by E6 the petitioner's fundamental right
of freedom of speech etc. outside the country was infringed, it became necessary to
consider whether the citizen had any such right."
"(6) [1937] a. c. 863. the passport act provides for issue of passports and travel documents for regulating the departure
from india of citizens of india and other persons. if the provisions comply with the requirements of
article 2 1, that is, if they comply with the procedure established by law the validity of the act cannot
be challenged."
"the result of the discussion, therefore, is that the validity of the passport act will
have to be examined on the basis whether it directly and immediately infringes on any of the
fundamental right of the petitioner. if a passport is refused according to procedure established by
law, the plea that his other fundamental rights are denied cannot be raised if they are not directly
infringed. the decisions of the supreme court wherein the right of person to travel abroad has been
dealt with may be noticed."
"the decisions of the supreme court wherein the right of person to travel abroad has been
dealt with may be noticed. in satwant singh v. assistant passport officer, delhi(1) the court held
that though a passport was not required for leaving, for practical purposes no one can leave or enter
into india without a passport. therefore, a passport is essential for leaving and entering india."
"in satwant singh v. assistant passport officer, delhi(1) the court held
that though a passport was not required for leaving, for practical purposes no one can leave or enter
into india without a passport. therefore, a passport is essential for leaving and entering india. the
court held the right to travel is part of personal liberty and a person could not be deprived of it
except according to the procedure laid down by law."
"freedom of movement is basic in our
scheme of values."" in a subsequent decision--zemel v. rusk(3) the court sustained against due
process attacks the government's refusal to issue passports for travel to ouba because the refusal
was grounded on foreign policy considerations affecting all citizens. ""the requirements of due
process are a function not only of the extent of the governmental restriction imposed, but also of the
extent of the necessity for the restriction."""
"v. secretary of state,(1) the court struck down a congressional prohibition of
international travel by members of the communist party. in a subsequent decision the court upheld
the government's refusal to issue passports for travel to cuba, because the refusal was on foreign
policy consideration affecting all citizens [zenel v, rusk (supra)]. thus an american's citizen's right
to travel abroad may also be restricted under certain conditions."
"i will not proceed to examine the
provisions of passport act, act 15 of 1967, to determine whether the provisions of the act are in
accordance with the procedure established by law. the preamble states that the act is to provide for the issue of passports and travel documents to
regulate the departure from india of citizens of india and other persons and for matters incidental
or ancillary thereto. it may be remembered that this act was passed after the supreme court had
held in satwant singh v. union of india'(1) that the right to tavel abroad is a part of person's
personal liberty of which he could not be deprived except in accordance with the procedure
established by law in terms of article 21 of the constitution."

permit was granted and was subsequently sought to be revoked it has to be treated differently from
that of refusing permission at the first instance. as in the present case the passport which has been

satisfaction of the passport authority and that as the decision is purely 'administrative in character it
cannot be questioned in a court of law except on very limited grounds. though the courts had taken
the view that the principle of natural justice is inapplicable to administrative orders, there 'is a
change in the judicial opinion subsequently."

an order under s. 10 (3) (c) is subject to a judicial scrutiny and that it can be looked

a rational and reasonable nexus to the interests of the general public. it was next contended on behalf of the petitioner that the provisions of s. 10(5) of the
