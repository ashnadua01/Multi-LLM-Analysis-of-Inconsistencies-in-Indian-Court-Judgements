i. the electoral bond scheme skews the principle of one person, one vote

     political parties and electoral outcomes;

     parties enabling significant policy influence; and (iii) non-disclosure of
     information on political funding to shareholders;

     funding are violative of the right to information under article 19(1)(a)."
"information

      eighty one percent of the contributions (rupees 580.52 crores) were received

      voluntary contributions is not regulated, it allowed the circulation of black

"since the amount of
      voluntary contributions is not regulated, it allowed the circulation of black
      money. however, after the introduction of the electoral bond scheme, forty-
      seven percent of the contributions were received through electoral bonds
      which is regulated money. the union of india submitted that providing
      anonymity to the contributors incentivizes them to contribute through the
      banking channel."

     does not provide any regulatory check to prevent the trading of bonds though

"there are two limbs to the argument of the union
     of india with respect to the purpose of donor privacy. first, that the state
     interest in introducing the electoral bond scheme which guarantees
     confidentiality (or anonymity) to financial contributions is that it furthers donor
     privacy; and second, this state interest facilitates a guaranteed fundamental
     right. thus, the submission of the state is that the right to information can be
     restricted even if donor privacy is not traceable to the grounds in article 19(2)
     because privacy is a fundamental right in itself."

     balances the right to information and right to informational privacy of political
     affiliation. i.         informational privacy of financial contributions to political parties
     132."
"having concluded that the constitution guarantees a right to informational
     privacy of political affiliation, it needs to be decided if the right can be extended
     to the contributions to political parties. the electoral bond scheme has two
     manifestations of privacy: first, informational privacy by prescribing
     confidentiality vis-ã -vis the political party; and second, informational privacy
     by prescribing non-disclosure of the information of political contributions to
     the public. the union of india submitted that contributions made to political
     parties must be protected both from the political party itself and the public
     because donor privacy is an extension of the principle of secret ballot and is
     a facet of free and fair E8"
"privacy vis-ã -vis political party
       143. the second issue is whether the right to privacy of political contributions can
            be extended to include privacy vis-ã -vis the political party to which
            contributions are made since according to the union of india under the
            electoral bond scheme, the political party to which the contribution is made
            would not know the particulars of the contributor. hence, it is submitted that
            the scheme is akin to the secret ballot."
"under the current scheme, it
            is still open to the political party to coerce persons to contribute. thus, the
            argument of the union of india that the electoral bond scheme protects the

       section 29c of the rpa to implement the electoral bond scheme because
       the ebs mandates anonymity of the contributor. in this section, we will
       answer the question of whether the ebs adequately balances the right to
       informational privacy of the contributor and the right to information of the voter."
"there is no nexus between
      the balancing measure adopted with the purpose of disclosure of information
      to the voter. according to clause 7(4) of the electoral bond scheme and the
      amendments, the information about contributions made through the electoral
      bond scheme is exempted from disclosure requirements. this information is
      never disclosed to the voter."
"thus, this alternative realizes the objective of securing disclosure for an
     informed voter and informational privacy to political affiliation in a âreal and
     substantial mannerâ. the measure in the electoral bond scheme completely
     tilts the balance in favor of the purpose of informational privacy and abrogates
     informational interests. on an overall comparison of the measure and the
     alternative, the alternative is better suited because it realizes the purposes to
     a considerable extent and imposes a lesser restriction on the fundamental
     rights."

    to section 29c(1) of the rpa are unconstitutional."
"the question is whether
    this court should only strike down the non-disclosure provision in the electoral
    bond scheme, that is clause 7(4). however, as explained above, the
    anonymity of the contributor is intrinsic to the electoral bond scheme. the
    electoral bond is not distinguishable from other modes of contributions
    through the banking channels such as cheque transfer, transfer through the
    electronic clearing system or direct debit if the anonymity component of the
    scheme is struck down."
