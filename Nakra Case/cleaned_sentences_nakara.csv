"pension
would now be on the higher side on account of two fortuitous
circumstances, namely,  that the  pay scales  permit  annual
increments and  usually there are promotions in the last one
or two  years of  the employee's  service. coupled with it a
slab system  for computation  has been  introduced  and  the
ceiling of  pension has  been raised. pensioners who retired
prior to  the specified  date would  suffer triple jeopardy,

     (iii) both  the impugned memoranda do not spell out the
raison d'etre  for liberalising  the pension formula. in the
affidavit in opposition it is stated that the liberalisation
was decided  by the  government in  view of  the  persistent
demand of  the employees  represented in the scheme of joint
consultative machinery."
"this would  clearly imply  that the
pre-liberalised scheme  did not  provide adequate protection
in old  age, and that a further liberalisation was necessary
as a  measure of economic security. the government also took
note of the fact that continuous upward movement of the cost
of living  index and  diminishing purchasing  power of rupee
necessitated upward E2 when the government
favourably responded  to the  demand it  thereby ipso  facto
conceded that  there was  a larger  available national cake,
part  of  which  could  be  utilised  for  providing  higher
security  to   retiring  employees."
"if  removal of arbitrariness can be brought about by
severing the  mischievous portion,  the discriminatory  part
ought  to  be  removed  retaining  the  beneficial  portion. [198 f]
     in the  instant case, the petitioners do not challenge,
but seek  the benefit  of the  liberalised  pension  scheme. their grievance  is of  the denial  to them  of the  same by
arbitrary introduction  of words  of  limitation."

"some landmark changes may be noticed. the first central pay commission (1946-47) recommended that the age of E1 in future
should be uniformly T17 for all services and the scale of pension should be 1/80 of the
emoluments for each year of service, subject to a limit of 35/80 with a ceiling of rs. 8,000 per year
for 35 years of service, which the government of india while accepting the recommendation raised
to rs."

"the second
central pay commission (1957-58) re-affirmed that the age of superannuation should be T17
for all classes of public servants but did not recommend any increase in the non- contributory
E1 benefits and recommended that if in future any improvement is to be made, it was the
considered view of the commission that these benefits should be on a contributory basis. the
administrative reforms commission ('arc' for short) set up by the government of india in T19
took note of the fact that the cost of living has shot up and correspondingly the possibility of savings
has gone down and consequently the drop in wages on E1 is in reality much steeper than
what the quantum of pension would indicate, and accordingly the arc recommended that thed.s. nakara & others vs union of india on 17 december, 1982

discriminatory action of the government is liable to be struck down, unless it can be
shown by the government that the departure was not arbitrary, but was based on
some valid principle which in itself was not irrational, unreasonable or
discriminatory. the basic contention as hereinbefore noticed is that the pensioners for the purpose of
receiving pension form a class and there is no criterion on which classification of
pensioners retiring prior to specified date and retiring subsequent to that date can
provide a rational principle correlated to object, viz., object underlying payment of
pensions. in reply to this contention set out in para 19 of the petition, mr. s.n."

respectability, state obligation to provide security in old age, an escape from undeserved want was
recognised and as a first step pension was treated not only as a reward for past service but with a
view to helping the employee to avoid destitution in old age. the quid pro quo, was that when the
employee was physically and mentally alert he rendered unto master the best, expecting him to look
after him in the fall of life."
"(see E1 systems for public employees by bleakney, page 33.) as
the present case is concerned with superannuation pension, a brief history of its initial introduction
in early stages and continued existence till today may be illuminating. superannuation is the most
descriptive word of all but has become obsolescent because it seems ponderous."
"superannuation is the most
descriptive word of all but has become obsolescent because it seems ponderous. its genesis can be
traced to the first act of parliament (in u.k.) to be concerned with the provision of pensions
generally in public offices. it was passed in 1810."
"it was passed in 1810. the act which substantively devoted itself
exclusively to the problem of superannuation pension was superannuation act of 1834. these are
landmarks in pension history because they attempted for the first time to establish a comprehensive
and uniform scheme for all whom we may now call civil servants."
"the act which substantively devoted itself
exclusively to the problem of superannuation pension was superannuation act of 1834. these are
landmarks in pension history because they attempted for the first time to establish a comprehensive
and uniform scheme for all whom we may now call civil servants. even before the 19th century, the
problem of providing for public servants who are unable, through old age or incapacity, to continue
working, has been recognised, but methods of dealing with the problem varied from society to
society and even occasionally from department to department."
"the
report of the commission is known as ""northcote-trevelyan report"". the report was pungent in its
criticism when it says that: ""in civil services comparable to lightness of work and the certainty of
provision in case of E1 owing to bodily incapacity, furnish strong inducements to the
parents and friends of sickly youths to endeavour to obtain for them employment in the service of
the government, and the extent to which the public are consequently burdened; first with the
salaries of officers who are obliged to absent themselves from their duties on account of ill health,
and afterwards with their pensions when they retire on the same plea, would hardly be credited by
those who have not had opportunities of observing the operation of the system"" (see gerald rhodes,
public sector pensions, pp. 18-19)."
"this approach is utterly unfair because in modern times public services are manned by those who
enter at a comparatively very young age, with selection through national competitive examination
and ordinarily the best talent gets the opportunity. let us therefore examine what are the goals that pension scheme seeks to subserve ? a pension
scheme consistent with available resources must provide that the pensioner would be able to live: (i)
free from want, with decency, independence and self-respect, and (ii) at a standard equivalent at the
pre-retirement level."

"these objectives are in turn a determinant of a social policy. the law is one of
the chief instruments whereby the social policies are implemented and 'pension is paid according to
rules which can be said to provide social security law by which it is meant those legal mechanisms
primarily concerned to ensure the provision for the individual of a cash income adequate, when
taken along with the benefits in kind provided by other social services (such as free medical aid) to
ensure for him a culturally acceptable minimum standard of living when the normal means of doing
so failed'. (see social security law by prof. harry calvert, p. 1)."
"(see social security law by prof. harry calvert, p. 1). viewed in the light of the present day notions pension is a term applied to periodic money payments
to a person who retires at a certain age considered age of disability; payments usually continue for
the rest of the natural life of the recipient. the reasons underlying the grant of pension vary from
country to country and from scheme to scheme."
"viewed in the light of the present day notions pension is a term applied to periodic money payments
to a person who retires at a certain age considered age of disability; payments usually continue for
the rest of the natural life of the recipient. the reasons underlying the grant of pension vary from
country to country and from scheme to scheme. but broadly stated they are (i) as compensation to
former members of the armed forces or their dependents for old age, disability, or death (usually
from service causes),
(ii) as old age E1 or disability benefits for civilian employees, and (iii) as social security
payments for the aged, disabled, or deceased citizens made in accordance with the rules governing
social service programmes of the country."
"under the second head they have been in force in one form or another in some countries for over a
century but those coming under the third head are relatively of recent origin, though they are of the
greatest magnitude. there are other views about pensions such as charity, paternalism, deferred
pay, rewards for service rendered, or as a means or promoting general welfare (see encyclopaedia
britannica, vol. 17 p.575.)"
"pension to civil employees of the government and the defence personnel as administered in india
appear to be a compensation for service rendered in the past. however, as held in douge v. board of
education(1) a pension is closely akin to wages in that it consists of payment provided by an
employer, is paid in consideration of past service and serves the purpose of helping the recipient
meet the expenses of living. this appears to be the nearest to our approach to pension with the
added qualification that it should ordinarily ensure freedom from undeserved want."

judicially defined as a stated allowance or stipend made in consideration of past service or a
surrender of rights or emoluments to one retired from service. thus the pension payable to a
government employee is earned by rendering long and efficient service and therefore can be said to
be a deferred portion of the compensation or for service rendered. in one sentence one can say that
the most practical raison d'etre for pension is the inability to provide for oneself due to old age."

jurisprudence 2d. 881)."
"881). from the discussion three things emerge : (i) that pension is neither a bounty nor a matter of grace
depending upon the sweet will of the employer and that it creates a vested right subject to T7 rules
which are statutory in character because they are enacted in exercise of powers conferred by the
proviso to art. 309 and clause (5) of art."
"309 and clause (5) of art. 148 of the constitution ; (ii) that the pension is not an
ex-gratia payment but it is a payment for the past service rendered ; and (iii) it is a social welfare
measure rendering socio-economic justice to those who in the hey-day of their life ceaselessly toiled
for the employer on an assurance that in their old age they would not be left in lurch. it must also be
noticed that the quantum of pension is a certain percentage correlated to the average emoluments
drawn during last T20 of service reduced to ten months under liberalised pension scheme."

paramount importance."

petitioners, nay they are ardent supporters of it, nay further they seek the benefit of it."

retired from service after a certain date. in other words, they challenge that the scheme must be
uniformly enforced with regard to all pensioners for the purpose of computation of pension

was governed by the T7 rules. no doubt, the benefit of the scheme will be available from the
specified date, irrespective of the fact when the concerned government servant actually retired from
service."

"in the affidavit in opposition by shri s.n. mathur, it has been stated that the liberalisation
of pension of retiring government servants was decided by the government in view of the persistent

"earlier the scheme was not that liberal keeping in
view the definition of average emoluments and the absence of slab system and a lower ceiling. those
who rendered the same service earned less pension and are exposed to the vagary of rising prices
consequent upon the inflationary inputs. if therefore, those who are to retire subsequent to the
specified date would feel the pangs in their old age, of lack of adequate security, by what stretch of
imagination the same can be denied to those who retired earlier with lower emoluments and yet are
exposed to the vagaries of the rising prices and the falling purchasing power of the rupee."
"and the
greater misfortune is that they are becoming older and older compared to those who would be
retiring subsequent to the specified date. the government was perfectly justified in liberalising the
pension scheme. in fact it was overdue."
"in fact it was overdue. but we find no justification for arbitrarily selecting the
criteria for eligibility for the benefits of the scheme dividing the pensioners all of whom would be
retirees but falling on one or the other side of the specified date. therefore, let us proceed to examine whether there was any rationale behind the eligibility
qualification."

severance an attempt is made to include them in the scheme it is not cutting down the class or the
scope but enlarge the ambit of the scheme which is impermissible even under the doctrine of
severability. in this context it was lastly submitted that there is not a single case in india or
elsewhere where the court has included some category within the scope of provisions of a law to
maintain its constitutionality."
"we are all the more happy for the chance of scribbling on a clean slate. if it appears to be undisputable, as it does to us that the pensioners for the purpose of pension
benefits form a class, would its upward revision permit a homogeneous class to be divided by
arbitrarily fixing an eligibility criteria unrelated to purpose of revision, and would such classification
be founded on some rational principle ? the classification has to be based, as is well settled, on some
rational principle and the rational principle must have nexus to the objects sought to be achieved."
"the classification has to be based, as is well settled, on some
rational principle and the rational principle must have nexus to the objects sought to be achieved. we have set out the objects underlying the E4 if the state considered it necessary
to liberalise the pension scheme, we find no rational principle behind it for granting these benefits

"if the liberalisation was considered necessary for augmenting social
security in old age to government servants then those who retired earlier cannot be worst off than
those who retire later. therefore, this division which classified pensioners into two classes is not
based on any rational principle and if the rational principle is the one of dividing pensioners with a
view to giving something more to persons otherwise equally placed, it would be discriminatory. to
illustrate, take two persons, one retired just a day prior and another a day just succeeding the
specified date."
"both were in the same pay bracket, the average emolument was the same and both
had put in equal number of years of service. how does a fortuitous circumstance of retiring a day
earlier or a day later will permit totally unequal treatment in the matter of pension ? one retiring a
day earlier will have to be subject to ceiling of rs."

the rules accord differential and discriminatory treatment to equals in the matter of commutation of
pension. a 48 hours difference in matter of E1 would have a traumatic effect."
"the learned attorney-general contended that the scheme is to be taken as a whole or rejected as a
whole and the date from which it came into force is an integral and inseparable part of the scheme. the two sub-limbs of the submissions were that, (i) the court cannot make a scheme having
financial implications retroactive, and (ii) this court cannot grant any relief to the pensioners who
retired prior to a specified date because if more persons divide the available cake, the residue falling
to the share of each especially to those who are likely to be benefited by the scheme will be
comparatively smaller and as they are not before the court, no relief can be given to the pensioners. let us clear one misconception."
"let us clear one misconception. the pension scheme including the liberalised scheme available to
the government employees is non-contributory in character. it was not pointed out that there is

two days earlier ? it must be remembered that pension is relatable to qualifying service. it has
correlation to the average emoluments and the length of service."
"(see craies on statute law, sixth edition, p.
387). assuming the government had not prescribed the specified date and thereby provided that
those retiring pre and post the specified date would all be governed by the liberalised pension

revision of existing scheme."
"this is just and fair. now if pension as we view it, is some kind of
E1 wages for past service, can it be denied to those who retired earlier, revised E1
benefits being available to future retirees only ? therefore, there is no substance in the contention
that the court by its approach would be making the scheme retroactive, because it is implicit in
theory of wages."
"undoubtedly when an upward revision is introduced, a date from
which it becomes effective has to be provided. it is the event of E1 subsequent to the
specified date which introduces discrimination in one otherwise homogeneous class of pensioners. this arbitrary selection of the happening of event subsequent to specified date denies equality of
treatment to persons belonging to the same class, some preferred and some omitted."

"we find no difficulty in A50 omitting the event happening
after the specified date retaining the more humane formula for computation of pension. it would

pension will have to be recomputed by applying the rule of average emoluments as set out in rule 34

scheme is prospective."
"but we make it abundantly clear that arrears are not required to be made because to that extent the
scheme is prospective. all pensioners whenever they retired would be covered by the liberalised
pension scheme, because the scheme is a scheme for E4 to a pensioner governed by
T7 rules. the date of E1 is irrelevant."
"the date of E1 is irrelevant. but the revised scheme would be operative from the
date mentioned in the scheme and would bring under its umbrella all existing pensioners and those
who retired subsequent to that date. in case of pensioners who retired prior to the specified date,
their pension would be computed afresh and would be payable in future commencing from the
specified date."

who retired subsequent to that date. in case of pensioners who retired prior to the specified date,
their pension would be computed afresh and would be payable in future commencing from the
specified date. no arrears would be payable."
"and that would take care of the grievance of
retrospectivity. in our opinion, it would make a marginal difference in the case of past pensioners
because the emoluments are not revised. the last revision of emoluments was as per the
recommendation of the third pay commission (raghubar dayal commission)."
"if the emoluments
remain the same, the computation of average emoluments under amended rule 34 may raise the
average emoluments, the period for averaging being reduced from last 36 months to last 10 months. the slab will provide slightly higher pension and if someone reaches the maximum the old lower
ceiling will not deny him what is otherwise justly due on computation. the words ""who were in
service on 31st march, T40 and A13 on or after the date""
excluding the date for commencement of revision are words of limitation introducing
the mischief and are vulnerable as denying equality and introducing an arbitrary
fortuitous circumstance can be severed without impairing the formula."
"14, the approach is not: 'either take it or leave it', the
approach is removal of arbitrariness and if that can be brought about by severing the
mischievous portion the court ought to remove the discriminatory part retaining the
beneficial portion. the pensioners do not challenge the liberalised pension scheme. they seek the benefit of it."

government servant retires. state grants upward E2 undoubtedly

portion."
"that removes the nefarious unconstitutional part and retains the beneficial
portion. it does not adversely affect future pensioners and their presence in the
petitions becomes irrelevant. but before we do so, we must look into the reasons
assigned for eligibility criteria, namely, 'in service on the specified date and retiring
after that date'."
"the court held that the central government cannot pick out a date from a hat and that is what it
seems to have done in saying that a period prior to that date would not be deemed to be approved by
the central government within the second proviso. in case before us, the eligibility criteria for being
eligible for liberalised pension scheme have been picked out from where it is difficult to gather and
no rationale is discernible nor one was attempted at the hearing. the ratio of the decision would
squarely apply to the facts of this case."
"and apart from
the first test that the division must be referable to some rational principle, if the choice of the date or
classification is wholly unrelated to the objects sought to be achieved, it cannot be upheld on the
specious plea that was the choice of the legislature. now if the choice of date is arbitrary, eligibility criteria is unrelated to the object sought to be
achieved and has the pernicious tendency of dividing an otherwise homogeneous class, the question
is whether the liberalised pension scheme must wholly fail or that the pernicious part can be
severed, cautioning itself that this court does not legislate but merely interprets keeping in view the
underlying intention and the object, the impugned measure seeks to subserve ? even though it is not
possible to oversimplify the issue, let us read the impugned memoranda deleting the
unconstitutional part."
"even though it is not
possible to oversimplify the issue, let us read the impugned memoranda deleting the
unconstitutional part. omitting it, the memoranda will read like this :
""at present, pension is calculated at the rate of 1/80th of average emoluments for
each completed year of service and is subject to a maximum of 33/80 of average
emoluments and is further restricted to a monetary limit of rs. 1,000/- per month."
"1,000/- per month. the president is, now, pleased to decide that with effect from 31st march, T40 the
amount of pension shall be determined in accordance with the following slabs."" if from the impugned memoranda the event of being in service and retiring subsequent to specified

will have to be recomputed in accordance with the provisions of the liberalised pension scheme as

31st march, T40 but A13 in or after that date' can be legally and validly severed and
must be struck down. the date is retained without qualification as the effective date for
implementation of scheme, it being made abundantly clear that in respect of all pensioners
governed by T7 rules, the pension of each may be recomputed as on april 1, T40 and future
payments be made in accordance with fresh computation under the liberalised pension scheme as
enacted in the impugned memoranda. no arrears for the period prior to 31st march, T40 in

"no arrears for the period prior to 31st march, T40 in

correlated to the date of E1 the court cannot change the date of E1 and impose
fresh commutation benefit. we are doing nothing of this kind."
"the date of E1 of each employee remains as it is. the average emoluments have
to be worked out keeping in view the emoluments drawn by him before E1 but in accordance
with the principles of the liberalised pension scheme. the two features which make the liberalised

"march 31, T40 there is no question of fresh E21 of the
pensioners who retired prior to 31st march, T40 and have already availed of the benefit of
commutation. it is not open to them to get that benefit at this late date because commutation has to
be availed of within specified time limit from the date of actual E1"

indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1416283/ 32the liberalised pension scheme, is to ignore the constitutional mandate. similarly, the court is not
conferring benefits by this approach, the court only removes the illegitimate classification and after
its removal the law takes its own course."
"we entertain no such apprehension. the executive with parliamentary mandate liberalised the
pension scheme. it is implicit in liberalising the scheme that the deed to grant little higher rate of
pension to the pensioners was considered eminently just."
"the executive with parliamentary mandate liberalised the
pension scheme. it is implicit in liberalising the scheme that the deed to grant little higher rate of
pension to the pensioners was considered eminently just. one could have understood persons in the
higher pay bracket being excluded from the benefits of the scheme because it would have meant that
those in higher pay bracket could fend for themselves."
"parliament would not have hesitated to
extend the benefit otherwise considered eminently just, and this becomes clearly discernible from
page 35 of 9th report of committee on petitions (sixth lok sabha) april, 1976. while examining
their representation for better pensionary benefit, the committee concluded as under:
""the committee are of the view that government owe a moral responsibility to
provide adequate relief to its retired employees including pre T31 pensioners,
whose actual value of pensions has been eroded by the phenomenal rise in the prices
of essential commodities. in view of the present economic conditions in india and
constant rise in the cost of living due to inflation, it is all the more important even
from purely humanitarian considerations if not from the stand point of fairness and
justice, to protect the actual value of their meagre pensions to enable the pensioners
to live in their declining years with dignity and in reasonable comfort."""

strike down the unconstitutional part, the parliament would not have enacted the measure."
"however in this connection, we want
to steer clear of a misconception. there is no pension fund as it is found either in contributory
pension schemes administered in foreign countries or as in insurance-linked pensions. non-
contributory pensions under T7 rules is a state obligation."

granting since nearly a T32 temporary increases from time to time to pensioners. therefore, the
difference will be marginal."
"therefore, the
difference will be marginal. further, let it not be forgotten that the old pensioners are on the way out and their number is fast
decreasing. while examining the financial implication, this court is only concerned with the
additional liability that may be imposed by bringing in pensioners who retired prior to april 1, T40
within the fold of liberalised pension scheme but effective subsequent to the specified date."

"that it is

echelons of service such as peons, l.d.c., u.d.c., assistant etc. in a chart submitted to us, the

keeping in view that the old pensioners are getting temporary increases. amongst the higher
officers, there will be some difference because the ceiling is raised and that would introduce the
difference."
"it is however necessary to refer to one figure relied upon by respondents. it was said that
if pensioners who retired prior to 31st march, T40 are brought within the purview of the liberalised
pension scheme, rs. 233 crores would be required for fresh commutation."
"the apparent fallacy in
the submission is that if the benefit of commutation is already availed of, it cannot and need not be
reopened. and availability of other benefits is hardly a relevant factor because pension is admissible
to all retirees. the figures submitted are thus neither frightening nor the liability is supposed to be
staggering which would deflect us from going to the logical end of constitutional mandate."
"even
according to the most liberal estimate, the average yearly increase is worked out to be rs. 51 crores
but that assumes that every pensioner has survived till date and will continue to survive. therefore,
we are satisfied that the increased liability consequent upon this judgment is not too high to be
unbearable or such as would have detracted the government from covering the old pensioners
under the scheme."

"its
members consist of public spirited citizens who have taken up the cause of ventilating legitimate
public problems. this society received a large number of representations from old pensioners,
individually unable to undertake the journey through labyrinths of legal judicial process, costly and
protracted, and. therefore, approached petitioner no."
"nakara & others vs union of india on 17 december, 1982
indian kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1416283/ 34that is the end of the journey. with the expanding horizons of socio-economic justice, the socialist
republic and welfare state which we endeavour to set up and largely influenced by the fact that the
old men who retired when emoluments were comparatively low and are exposed to vagaries of
continuously rising prices, the falling value of the rupee consequent upon inflationary inputs, we are
satisfied that by introducing an arbitrary eligibility criteria: 'being in service and retiring subsequent
to the specified date' for being eligible for the liberalised pension scheme and thereby dividing a
homogeneous class, the classification being not based on any discernible rational principle and
having been found wholly unrelated to the objects sought to be achieved by grant of liberalised
pension and the eligibility criteria devised being thoroughly arbitrary, we are of the view that the
eligibility for liberalised pension scheme of being in service on the specified date and retiring
subsequent to that date' in impugned memoranda, exhibits p-i and p-2, violates art. 14 and is
